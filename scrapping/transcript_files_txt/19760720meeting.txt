 FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE MEETING  July 19-20, 1976  Prefatory Note  This transcript has been produced from the original raw transcript in the FOMC 
Secretariat's files. The Secretariat has lightly ed
ited the original to facilitate the reader's 
understanding. Where one or more words were 
missed or garbled in the transcription, the

 instances, words have been added in brackets 
to complete a speaker's thought or to correct an
 obvious transcription error or misstatement. 
 Errors undoubtedly remain. The raw transcript was not fully edited for accuracy at

July 19-20, 1976  [Executive session] 
 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we have a brief meeti
ng scheduled for this afternoon.  There are two items to take up.  First of all,
 when I testified recently--what was the date? MR. BROIDA.  June 30. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, June 30, before the Joint Economic Committee, I was asked 
about the Memorandum of Discussi
on by Mr. Reuss and also by Mr. Proxmire.  I™d previously 
heard from Mr. Proxmire, who had written me a letter, and both urged that the Committee 

reconsider its decision to eliminate the Memorandum of Discussi
on.  Now, I believe that Mr. Broida sent you a copy of the transcript of that discussion.  As I recall, at the hearing, I dealt with the questions adequately, or at least I thought so at the time.  The Memorandum of Discussion 
and what we should do with it was considered very carefully by th
e [Committee], and we 
discussed it formally over a period of several m
onths, and informally all of us have thought 
about it for some time.   
There™s only one new fact that I™m aware of, 
which is that, since we reached that decision, the only criticisms that we™ve received have come from these two gentlemen.  And I indicated 

that at the hearing, and since then I haven™t heard a word from anyone, either directly or indirectly.  That is the only 
new fact that I know of.  Now th
e question is before the Committee 
[unintelligible] to reconsider that decision.  If so we shall do so.  If not, we shall inform the two chairmen that this was taken up by the Committ
ee and we™ve decided that the earlier decision 
should stand.  What is the wish of the Committee? 
MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I don™t think we
 ought to change [that decision].  I think the best example I know of in our government of
 the reason to [not] change is the highest decisionmaking body of people in our government
, the Supreme Court of the United States, 
composed of a number of learned people who give 
decisions that affect the lives of our people as much as we do, if not more so.  And if I [understand correctly], and I™d bow to members of 
counsel around the table, they don™t give the deliberative process by which they arrive at a conclusion.  They give a conclusion which was concurred with by all.   And to a significant extent, our minutes of actions or the type 
of disclosure that we give now goes substantially beyond anything that the decisionmaking process in the judiciary goes 
through, and outlines all alternativ
es that were considered and 
the range of discretion.  And I 
think from the public policy point of
 view that is sufficient.  I don™t see any outcry on the part of attorneys claiming that the Suprem
e Court of the United States must keep a verbatim transcript 
for scholars to research later.  And I just frankly never understood why there was this outcry for this body to do the same thing. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we haven™t had any outcry.  That is really what we 
anticipated--we anticipated that there would be very little criticism, but I must say I did 
7/19-20/76 - 2 - 
anticipate more than we™ve received.  To repeat, we™ve been cr
iticized by Mr. Reuss, by Mr. Proxmire, and I™m not aware of any other criticis
m from any other source.  Yes, Mr. MacLaury. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 Phil, I wonder whether the Supreme 
Court analogy is apt or exact enough.  I personally have not made up 
my mind.  I don™t feel 
strongly one way or the other on the substance of the issue of whet
her we reconsider our decision or not.  But in some sense this whole judicial sy
stem as I understand it is 
set up so that the final court of appeals is the Suprem
e Court, and their word, so to speak, is the last word.   I don™t think anyone has quite accorded this group that same distinct
ion or place in our system.  We are accustomed to being second 
guessed from beginning to
 end, and therefore, maybe the arguments by which we arrive at our 
conclusion are just fodder for second guessing in the press or otherwise, whereas the Supreme Co
urt has spoken and there™s not much point [to 
seeing a transcript] because there™s no place el
se to go.  That™s my only comment on that 
particular analogy. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t think, if I may say this, I don™t think that the 
Supreme Court analogy which Mr. Jackson has just
 made played any role in the Committee™s 
decision.  Mr. Jackson has given his interpretation.  Well, 
that™s the way he looks at it.  I see the world a little differently.  The real question is not whether you agree with Mr. Jackson™s special, 
personal interpretation.  The real question is whether or not you believe that we ought to seriously sit down and reappraise our earlier decision on the Memora
ndum of Discussion. MR. MACLAURY.  In that context, though, one of the things that we did discuss a good deal in arriving at this conclusion, one of the things that we cannot really discuss except in executive session, is the role of the Government in
 the Sunshine bill, and not just the particular bill but where we stand on the court suit that
 was brought by the Georgetown lawyers.  And, 
frankly, I have lost track of where that stands, that court test of our disclosure of the minutes of 
January 1975.  I would just like to be brought up to date if I could.  I do think that it has some 
relevance for our consideration.  And then, finally, I™m just musing personally about whether or 
not the Memorandum of Discussion for the year 1
972 might not have been a useful document in 
the public domain to somehow dispel 
all of these false accusations about-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that document will be in the public domain. 

MR. MACLAURY.  Right, but I™m just thinking in
 terms of the future as well.  We have 
been subject to charges that we were politically motivated, partisanly motivated in 1972, charges 
which I know to be entirely false.  And it seem
s to me that the Memorandum of Discussion is 
perhaps the only document to which historians can look for some sort of trut
h in that particular issue.  We can make all of the protestations we 
want.  I just put that on the table.  I don™t know what it implies, but I thin
k it™s something to be cons
idered in our discussion. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s be clear about one thing.  Do we want a fresh debate on the Memorandum of Discussion?  Let 
us not go into the merits one wa
y or the other.  Let us have a show of hands on that. SPEAKER(?).  Voting members or all? 
7/19-20/76 - 3 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What™s that? 
SPEAKER(?).  Just members or all of us? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, well, let™s ha
ve a show of hands of all of us. 
MR. LILLY.  Before you have a show of hands, could I ask a question?  When you considered this before, did you consider the [unintelligible] that there is an electronic recording made of the same and just keep the recording? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, perhaps Mr. Broida can.  I do not recall specifically enough. MR. BROIDA.  The recording is made solely
 for the purpose of preparing whatever records-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But that™s not the question. 
MR. LILLY.  That™s not my point.  Is a recording made and why not just file the 
recording?  I don™t want to ask 
that question, I want to know if that was considered?  I don™t want to start a debate. MR. BROIDA.  No, that came up only in connec
tion with the Government in the Sunshine 
Act.  That was not specifically considered independently of that. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t recall.  Yes, Mr. Mayo. MR. MAYO.  I™d like to follow up on the point that Bruce made, which is really my only 
question.  I favor continuing our present position.  I don™t think we should be frogs and jump 
around just because two people who happen to be in
 a particular position 
like to see us jump.  
But I would like to have Mr. O™Connell™s counsel on this, as to whether he sees any prejudice to our position on the openness of our records in the instant case that Bruce referred to, by a 
decision one way or another in this particular instance.  Is there any relevance at all? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  May I comment on that, Mr. Chairman? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, please. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  If I may, President Mayo, 
at the time the Committee was considering 
its move with respect to the Memorandum [of Disc
ussion] and the questions put to me then--did 
I see any adverse impact--I gave the opinion that
 I saw none.  In the interim I have been 
presented with no fact or occurrence or development that changes that opinion.  So, as I said then, I think the Committee™s ac
tion was not in any sense adverse to, nor did it impede the 
pursuit of, that lawsuit, which is on appeal to the Court of Appeals from the portion of the 
District Court™s order that dealt with the action 
record of the Committee.  We did not take an 
appeal to pursue the ruling of the court with respect to the Me
morandum of Discussion.  If now 
the question is, does the possibility of reconsidering the Memorandum of Discussion action 
constitute an impediment to th
e pursuit of our cause of action, I think not.  I think wholly 7/19-20/76 - 4 - 
consistent, though, is the action the Committee has 
taken, and I™m perfectly 
satisfied to remain 
right where that is. 
MR MAYO.  Thank you, Tom.  In view of that
, I see no reason why we should change our mind. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Wallich. 

MR.WALLICH.  Well, if that pl
aintiff wins his suit, would that mean that, subsequently, 
Memoranda of Discussion might have to be pres
ented or a precedent set so that others could request the same thing? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Governor, 
I see nothing in the opinion of the lower court that mandates this Committee to keep a Memorandu
m of Discussion.  
Relating to the two Memoranda demanded, the court order would refl
ect upon those and those only.  Later, someone 
could bring a suit; if they did, the answer could be given that we no longer keep a Memorandum 
of Discussion.  We move to dismiss. 
MR. WALLICH.  But if we stil
l kept one and if someone else brought a suit, given this 
precedent, would that increase the probability th
at subsequent Memoranda would have to be 
released [unintelligible]? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I think definitely the answer would be yes. 

MR. BROIDA.  I don™t think you™d need a suit. 

MR. O™CONNELL.   You wouldn™t. 

MR. BROIDA.  We™d simply respond affirma
tively in the issue of [unintelligible]. MR. WALLICH.  That is the main ar
gument, then, against the Memorandum. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Because we don™t know yet the outcome of the suit. 
MR. BROIDA.  That part of it, I believe, is 
completed.  It™s not a
ppealed.  It™s not on appeal. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  The lower court™s order 
with respect to the Memorandum would 
declare, and we haven™t pursued the appeal in that respect, that the Memorandum of Discussion 
should be made available. MR.BROIDA.  [To release] segregable facts. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  Segregable facts.  With 
respect to the two Memoranda that were 
under discussion, the court™s order did not mandate disclosure by this Committee of facts and 

related [discussion] that were not ﬁreasonably segregable factsﬂ; only the latter were ordered to be made available.  If we reinstituted keep
ing the Memorandum of Di
scussion, it would require that, after each meeting, as promptly as possi
ble, staff would go through that Memorandum and 
7/19-20/76 - 5 - 
segregate reasonably segregable facts and have them, I think, set apart in a publicly available 
record if someone wanted to come in and ask for them. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Volcker now. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 
 I just wanted to clarify one question on which I think you have already expressed a judgment.  It seems 
to me that a very pragmatic question of great 
principle is at stake.  As near as I can see, we made a pragmatic judgment with good and 
sufficient reasons.  We ought to dispense with 
this [discussion].  The only new thing that has entered in is a congressional complaint.   
Pragmatically, I would say, if the [congressi
onal] committees are going to be upset, we 
would have to retreat if it got to the point of a [congressional] committee action.  I think I 
wouldn™t want to [before then].  Your judgment 
is, as I understand it, that this is far from a matter of great concern to the [congressional] comm
ittee; it really looks like these two people are 
not going to go further.  So we™re not going to have to
 [unintelligible] in the future.  And if this is 
all the complaint we have, there™s no reason that I 
would agree with that.  If indeed that is the 
correct judgment-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t know if it™s a correct judgment or not.  I am 
impressed by the fact that no one, literally, ap
art from these two gentlemen, has raised any 
question, in writing or orally, direc
tly or indirectly, with me.   
And while I did not anticipate mu
ch criticism, we™ve looked into the matter, and Joe Coyne 
explored this for me.  I did anticipate a number 
of protests.  And there haven™t been any.  Now Mr. Reuss at the hearing called on the journalistic fraternity, you see, to communicate with him.  
Well, I haven™t heard from one [journalist].  I haven™t seen an item in the press on this.  On the 
other hand--what do you call it, the monthly policy record? MR. BROIDA.  Yes. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the press is paying a good deal more attention to that, I think for two reasons.  First, because we put it out more promptly, and second it™s a more informative 
document than it used to be.  And in my testimony, 
I indicated that our staff is learning how to do this job.  And I meant that most sincerely.  
I™ve had numerous conversations with our staff on 
that, and I think that the monthly policy reco
rd is going to improve in quality and become 
increasingly more informative.  I think the public is far better informed now than it was before.  

And as this document improves, that 
will continue to be the case.   Well, gentlemen, we™re almost involved in a 
debate, whereas the real question at the moment is whether or not we s
hould be debating this issue.  And therefore, I return to the question--does the Committee want to reconsider
 our earlier decision with respect to the Memorandum.  If there is sufficient interest in 
that, we™ll schedule a full-fledged debate on it and take whatever time is needed.  You have a question, Mr. Guffey. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Well, only a comment, Mr. Chairm
an.  It seems to me, as you look back at 
what has happened, the [unintelligible] for doing away with the Memorandum of Discussion was 
a lawsuit and the fact that what happened at this table would go in the public domain very soon 
7/19-20/76 - 6 - 
after the meeting if they were 
successful in the lawsuit.  We 
decided to do away with the 
Memorandum of Discussion.  I can 
see nothing that has changed since that decision was made.  
If the congressmen feel strongly e
nough about it to give us the type of statute or legislation that says it would be held out of the public domain for 
five years, which they seem to agree is a good 
rule, then I would be prepared to go back to the Memorandum of
 Discussion.  I think it serves a useful purpose, but not in the context that we™re now facing. MR. COLDWELL.  Well, Mr. Chairman, as the 
only one who voted against this decision, I must say that I would prefer that we continue on with the Memorandum of
 Discussion.  But the Committee clearly voted it down, and I am not interest
ed in fighting [unintelligible].  So I™m not 
going to suggest we consider it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other comments? 

MR. BLACK.  When you report back, w
ouldn™t it look about, as you said, we had reconsidered it? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh yes, that
™s exactly what we™re doing now. 
MR. BLACK.  It™s a question of degree. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We™ve reconsidered it be
fore the question of reconsideration is put. MR. BLACK.  If words will be 
just as effective, well, that
™s one thing.  I would think a 
little more discussion might sound not too [unintelligible]. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, there™s 
another aspect to this.  It seems to be one could be 
responsive to Reuss and Proxmire by being more sp
ecific about [unintelligible]  improvements in 
the policy record.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.   That™s exactly what I intend to do [unintelligible] in the response. 

MR. BLACK.  If Mr. Chairman, they offered some-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I listened with the grav
est of interest to Mr. Guffey™s comment, 
and I cannot very well suggest any such legislation to the Congress.  But I would welcome it.  
Because, in that case, if there were such legi
slation--listen carefully, Tom--I assume that the 
court would not interfere, and that we could withhold that Memorandum of Discussion for a full 
five years as being the will of the Congress that we do so. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Absent, Mr. Chairman, the po
ssibility that a court of law could be asked to look at that particular statute to see if it contravenes the existing mandate of law in 
another statute, such as the Freedom of 
Information Act, these [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it could be the language of the statute.  Now, I™m not a 
lawyer, but you could write the statute indicating that this is the law without regard to what any other statute may say 
on a related subject. 7/19-20/76 - 7 - 
MR. O™CONNELL.  You could indeed.  In fact, [given] that [the new law] postdated such an existing statute, even reference in the 
new law to the congressi
onal knowledge of the existence of that [earlier statute] would help.  It could be avoided.  I™m merely saying that the 
possibility existed. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And also, I think such a statute would help enormously in the whole debate on secrecy.  But I don™t think such a statute is going to be written by the Congress, 
and I don™t think I™d be in a good position to sugges
t it, but I would welcome it.  Yes, Mr. Roos. 
MR. ROOS.  I wonder if we should not be very aware of the public relations aspect of this whole issue at a time when everybody from 
presidential candidates on down are harping on openness and sunshine, etc., etc.  From the point 
of view of our image 
with the public, it seems 
to me that it is an awfully difficult thing to defe
nd in the public arena that [we are] having this record [made public only] after five years.  I 
don™t suggest that we should flip flop, because I don™t think we want to be frogs, but if I were a Reuss or a Proxmire, I could have a field day 
exaggerating how secretive we ar
e and how fearful we are and how we are dragged screaming to 
the summons of sunshine.   
I think that, in the public ar
ena and in the political arena, we™re vulnerable in these 
positions we™re taking, but maybe the other concerns
 are far more compelling than just the public 
relations or public image of it. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we could turn the tables here.  Here we have two members 
of the Congress urging us in effect to maintain se
crecy over a period of five years.  And this is 
something we™re not willing to do because we be
lieve in openness and therefore we will reveal 
our doings after a period of only approximately 30
 days.  And that™s exactly what the monthly policy record does.   Now, it [omits] one thing, and one thing only.  It omits the names of individuals.  But after 
all, what the public wants to know is the thinking, the range of facts, the range of considerations that went into the Committee decision.  I do think 
that the monthly policy record will have to be 
expanded considerably.  It should become a rich
er document than it is.  And I think the second 
one was better than the first, and the third will be better than the second.  I think our staff has to learn how to do this job better than it has yet done it.
  This could be an artful letter to write, and let me call on you for a
ssistance on that letter. MR. JACKSON.  Be careful in writing the letter that we don™t suggest or bring up the subject of [the Government in the] Sunshine bill [in regard to] the Open Market Committee.  
You be very, very careful that we don™t bring that up. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh no, no, no, no, no-- 
SPEAKER(?).  Well, [unintelligible] does our answer to this request have any bearing on 
what Congress might do on the Government in the Sunshine bill? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I doubt it.  I doubt it very much.  
What does have a bearing on it, 
I™m afraid, and this is surmise on my part, is
 the pronouncement that Mr. Carter made on the 
Sunshine [bill] the other day.  Now I believe that Mr. Carter referred to [unintelligible].  
7/19-20/76 - 8 - 
Unfortunately, the Sunshine legislation as it stands in the Congress is very imperfectly 
understood by members of the Congress.   
And the fact is, or at least I™m so inform
ed time and again by our counsel, no Sunshine 
statute in any of our states calls for a verbatim 
transcript.  And if the present legislation were amended to eliminate the requirement of a verba
tim transcript, not all of our criticisms or 
difficulties would be met, but the greater part of 
our difficulty would just vanish.  We consider 
ourselves in reasonably good shape.  But I doubt if Mr. Carter knows this, and I would bet that, of the 535 legislators on Capitol Hill, you couldn™t find a half dozen who know this and understand it.  That™s the difficulty with the legislation.  [Its] name is so attractive.  Particularly 
at this time.  However, there is this about th
e political situation--I think some understanding is 
gaining on Capitol Hill.   Mr. Horton is going to offer an amendment, 
and he may offer more than one.  Well, 
suppose that the Horton amendment carries.  Very we
ll, then Sunshine legislation will still pass the Congress, the House overwhelmingly--[but] w
ith the Horton amendment--and we will be in 
reasonably good shape.  Now, next, if the Horton amendment fails, then I think members of the 
Congress will still overwhelmingly vote for that legi
slation.  What I™m sayi
ng is, therefore, that those who understand the difficulties that the Sunshine bill [present for] the Federal Reserve and one or two other agencies are not taking any significant political risks in voting for the Horton amendment.  They™ll still be for the Sunshine
 legislation, you see, no matter which way the 
Horton amendment goes.  And this is now understood by a fair number of congressmen.   
Also, I™ve been away for a few days--and Mr. Guenther couldn™t help, he™s been away, too--but the ﬁDear Colleagueﬂ 
letter has been prepared by Mr. Horton™s office, and it™s an excellent letter.  And a fair number of signature
s of Republicans and Democrats are now attached to it, and we™re going to have the strong support of Mr. Pepper, a Florida Congressman who has 
considerable influence, I think, as an elder statesman in the H
ouse of Representatives and a man 
who™s known for his liberal views.  Do you have any knowledge of that, Tom?  How that is 
progressing? MR. O™CONNELL.  The last word I had from Mr. Hort
on™s chief of staff, who™s handling this matter, was that they were 
quite pleased both with the number
 and the mix of signatures they 
had gotten.  They had gotten from us a suggestio
n that they visit both sides of the aisle in assembling these signatures, and they proceeded on 
that basis, and he said he was quite pleased 
with the number.  I don™t know the exact number, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we have a chance, anyhow.  Three months ago, two months 
ago, it seemed almost hopeless, but we kept on fighting.  And we will continue. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I will say, Mr. Chairman, th
at the Horton staff exhibited a good deal 
of pleasure in the Bella Abzug[unintelligible] co
lleague that she to some [unintelligible] had 
peaked a little bit in advance.  She anticipated 
that the bill would be on the floor of the House before they recessed, and they missed that.  He
r letter was distributed, and he feels that the impact of that letter has been 
severely diminished by that fact
.  And he™s pleased with the calendaring of his letter. 7/19-20/76 - 9 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know calling [unintelligible] Abzug is not doing us any 
injury in the House of Representatives. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  No. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --whether that is entirely fair or not, I don™t know, but I™m not 
complaining.  Any other question or comment 
on this first item of reconsideration? SPEAKER(?).  It seems to me, Mr. Chairma
n, that Mr. Guffey has summarized it about 
right.  We did consider all available facts, a
nd there has been no substantial change in the facts--therefore, no substantial basis for changing our views.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That is the letter that wi
ll be carefully written.  I™ll do my best to 
do that--emphasizing the new document and the plans for improving it and how much more 

enlightening it is going to be. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I can™t resist, Mr. Chairma
n, commenting that if that new document is 
enlarged far enough, we™ll have a Memorandum of 
Discussion without [unintelligible].  And 
promptly released. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, it will not be.  It wi
ll continue to be an analytic document, 
whereas in the Memorandum of Discussion you have
 the flow of conversation back and forth 
and therefore, to make much sense of it, you ha
ve to analyze it and distill what you can gather from it. 
MR. PARTEE.  I can™t resist 
then, Mr. Chairman--of course 
the document can™t have more 
in it than the discussion had.  Some
thing has to be said at the mee
ting to give the staff the basis for saying something on the analytic end. 
MR. MACLAURY.  I thought that was one of the strong points you made, Mr. Chairman, 
in your comment.  The criticism was that the firs
t examples [of the expanded Record of Policy 
Actions] were very bland, and your comment was that you can™t be less bland than the discussion.  And I think in that context the reverse is also implie
d, that if there are dissents or discussions, that those will be fully put on the record, and I would hope that that is really the 
answer to the criticism of these two gentlemen. 
 And maybe that would be
 said in the letter. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s a good point.  I™ll keep that in mind. 
MR. WALLICH.  Now, why is it, Mr. Chairma
n, so long as we have an opportunity to go over the draft, that names can™t be mentioned?  
I wouldn™t have an objection to having my name 
used in a way that I didn™t understand [if I could] protect myself. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think it can be done.  
I think the sentiment of the Committee was 
that this should not be done.  That would also be my view.  I think when you start mentioning 
names, identifying positions with individuals, one
 is inviting a certain emphasis on differences.  
And remember that this is a document that is
 now released approximately 30 days after our 
meeting.  To have the differences displayed by na
me could excite some of us unduly to extreme 
utterances.  And I think also that our critic
s on Capitol Hill and elsewhere would maximize and 
7/19-20/76 - 10 - 
exaggerate the differences among us, and the unity
 and the consensus that we should be striving for might well be lost
 in the process. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Y
ou™ve got to be incited. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that 
option is still available.  As a matter of fact, we have an 
opportunity right now because Mr. Broida indicates to me that 
we should have a formal vote on 
the reconsideration. 
SPEAKER(?).  Mr. Chairman let me just s
uggest that both the real problem and the strategy with our congressional friends would be ill se
rved by reconsideration at this time.  And I 
say that simply [because] we have a request only from the chairmen of these committees.  They 

do not [unintelligible] at this Committee, and for us
 to react too quickly because they requested it 
would be viewed by some of our very strong frie
nds, I am afraid, as something [unintelligible] 
and I would be reluctant to do that at this juncture. 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, just a matter of
 parliamentary procedure, shouldn™t we vote 
not to rescind our earlier action, rather than vote to reconsider? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s right.  The vote w
ill be not to change our earlier action.  
Not to rescind. MR. BROIDA.  To reaffirm the action to discontinue. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Let™s put it po
sitively.  We™ll vote to reaffirm our earlier 
action.  We™re voting on that motion. 
MR. BROIDA.   
Chairman Burns Yes 

Vice Chairman Volcker Yes 

Mr. Balles  Yes 

Mr. Black  Yes 

Mr. Coldwell  You just changed the ground  rules.  I have  

   to vote No 
Mr. Gardner  Yes 
Mr. Jackson   Yes 

Mr. Kimbrel  Yes 

Mr. Lilly  Yes 

President Mayo  

 as alternate for  

 President Winn Yes 

Mr. Partee  Yes 

Mr. Wallich  Yes 
It™s 11 to 1, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good.  Let™s turn to the second item, which is the lawsuit 
[regarding the appointment process 
for Reserve Bank Presidents].   7/19-20/76 - 11 - 
We discussed this lawsuit at the last mee
ting of the Committee, and we discussed it once 
again in our telephone conference.  Now in that telephone conference, members of the Board did 
not participate apart from myself
, but all the Bank Presidents did.  The reason it was done that way was that I had heard about a criticism coming
 from a Bank President, and therefore I wanted 
to learn what I could about the sentiments of [a
ll the] Presidents.  Therefore, we could decide 
what other action to take.   My understanding of that telephone conference was that every one of the Bank Presidents was generally satisfied with the 
procedures that we had developed for handling the lawsuit.  Mr. O™Connell would you inform us no
w on this lawsuit™s status? MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I think I 
can be rather brief. 
 You may recall that 
the lawsuit originally called for filing our response within 20 days of June 22, either with a motion to dismiss or other answer.  In the interi
m, we have, with stipulation of counsel for Mr. Reuss, obtained an extension until the 30th of July.  The court approved that extension of time, 
so our pleading, whatever its nature, is due on or before July 30.  And that, again, is in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, before Judge Parker.   
At the same time, plaintiff™s counsel filed 
an amended complaint, which procedurally 
doesn™t enlarge or extend our time for answer, nor 
as we™ve read this complaint--and copies were 
given to [counsel at each Reserve Bank]--doesn™t really change the name of
 the game in terms of 
what we would be defending.  What the plainti
ff™s counsel has attempted to do in amending the 
complaint is to be more specific and to shore up, 
as we read it, the grounds on which he bases his claim that he is entitled to bring 
this lawsuit.  The legal title of such a claim 
is called ﬁstanding.ﬂ  And as we™re preparing our defense, of course, we intend to directly challenge, by motion to 
dismiss, the standing of the plai
ntiff to bring the lawsuit.   
The two bases for standing as originally filed were that, [first,] as a member of Congress, 
he had been deprived of certain legislative rights of voting and action by the five Reserve Bank Presidents who are members of the FOMC and th
eir participation in th
e FOMC meetings.  And 
that secondly, as a citizen holding a government [financial] obligation having $10,000 in 
value--he said 20 but he only needed 10 for juri
sdictional basis--he had been deprived because, 
by the action of these same five individuals, the value of 
that security had been adversely impacted.   
He has amended his complaint to further subs
tantiate the basis of this claim, or has 
attempted to.  I think he™s done himself as much ha
rm as good.  One of the add-ons that he put in 
was that it deprives him of the ri
ght to negotiate with the Senate
 in their voting on a presidential 
appointee, which he claims to be a prerogative of
 a member of the Hous
e of Representatives. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t understand that at all. MR. O™CONNELL.  I don™t understand it either, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  He seems to be taking 
on the Senate as well as this Committee. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  It would appear so.  That
™s my reason for saying I don™t think he™s helped himself.  But he seems-- 
7/19-20/76 - 12 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but
 encourage him in that. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I have other chores th
an to encourage him, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I don™t think he n
eeds too much, as we may find out. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What other argument?
  I haven™t read this supplement. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  The supplement also subst
ituted Tom Timlen of the New York Bank 
as a named defendant in place of Dick Debs.  That and the substituted cause of action claim are 

the only two changes he made in his amended comp
laint.  Other than that
 it™s identical to the 
original complaint. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  How does he argue the case that the five voting Bank Presidents 
have done injury to him as an owner of Treasury 
securities?  Does he tr
y to substantiate that? MR. O™CONNELL.  No, sir, he doesn™t.  In
 my judgment he makes the allegation and 
assumes that the five voting Presidents consti
tute the action ﬁimpulseﬂ of the Committee, and 
that by their vote alone, actions of the Committee are to be reflect
ed.  Namely, that what they voted, according to his allegation, [constitutes what] 
the Committee did, and his injury followed.   
Now, without picking that apart, he doesn™t go further to substantiate or identify his 
alleged injury with the five individuals named, or 
with the five Presidents and their alternates in 
the complaint.  It™s for that reason, of course, th
at we take the position that his thesis has to be 
read as a complaint against [the entire] FOMC.   
And that is the essence of his complaint, th
at the actions of the Federal Open Market 
Committee [are so important]--he 
claims [they are] the most im
perative and important actions 
short of [dropping] the A-bomb that can be ta
ken by any governmental unit--it follows that 
individual members who participate in this
 Committee action should be appointed by the 
President of the United States.  Because of the 
import of their work and their function.  But I 
think he fails to substantiate his allegation, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, does he make any 
attempt to substantiate his allegation? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  As I™ve told you, he alludes 
to the function that these five Presidents [perform] on the FOMC, and he thereafter describe
s the action of the FOMC.  He places them on 
that Committee, alleges that they were not c
onstitutionally appointed to the Committee and that, 
in their participation with other members of th
e Committee, they formulate and cause the result 
of this unconstitutional action.  And he asks th
e court to prevent them from doing so in the 
future, and he asks that the Banks be enjoined from carrying out the directive in [whose 
formulation] they participate.  That™s as far as 
he goes, Mr. Chairman, as I™ve read the complaint. 
SPEAKER(?).  How, Tom, does he suggest th
at five [Bank Presidents] can outvote seven [Governors]?  I™ve neve
r quite understood this. 7/19-20/76 - 13 - 
MR. O™CONNELL.  To my reading he makes no 
effort to suggest that five can outvote seven.  Perhaps he™ll argue that as he develops
 [an argument]--either in his motion of summary 
judgment or his reply brief--that all it takes is 
two members of the Board component joining with 
five Presidents if they so wish, and you™d have a ma
jority vote.  And that this could be the result and that™s exactly what it is, a ﬁcould-ism.ﬂ  A
nd that may well be what his [argument] would be. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know, I haven™t done this recently, but I™ve made an 
analysis of the voting by members of the Bo
ard and by the Bank Presidents and there is no difference, really.  And I believe that this is true.  You™ve been examining this figure. 
MR. BROIDA.  I was going to give a report on that. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, go ahead, please. 
MR. BROIDA.  We™ve examined all formal vot
es shown on all policy records since March 
1936.  We found one case in which a majority of the Board was outvoted by a minority of the 

Board plus Reserve Bank Presidents; that was the vote on the policy directive in December 1961.  
There are six cases in that span in which one
 Board member was absent, and the Board split 
three to three, and the decision was 
in effect made by the Presidents. 
SPEAKER(?).  It may only be speculation, To
m, but wouldn™t it be interesting if his 
$20,000 of government securities are of high-coupon i
ssues that are now selling at a premium? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  It would.  He hasn™t identifie
d what he holds.  As a matter of fact, in 
his amended complaint, he withdrew and removed 
the so-called allegation with respect to the 
$10,000--satisfying the $10,000 requirement.  It™s cont
ained later in the paragraph relating to the impact of Reserve Banks in carrying 
out the directive of the Committee. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You know, I™d love to argue the economics of his complaint, 
which is something very different from the la
w, because if his Treas
ury securities are worth 
anything at all, it™s in large part due to the 
existence of this Committee and how this Committee 
has functioned over the years.  It™s been a restraining force, a
nd inflation has not ruined Mr. Reuss.  He has this Committee to thank more than 
any other group or individual.  Left to himself, 
he™d even be in ruins.  We saved him from his mistakes. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible.] 
MR. O™CONNELL.  President Volcker, if our
 motion on standing fails and the matter goes 
to trial, he has made known his intention to pr
oduce expert witnesses who will--starting with the 
security purchase--trace its value 
over a period of months.  [The 
experts] purportedly will testify 
that its value has now diminished and it™s direc
tly the result, according to
 the experts, of the 
action taken by the FOMC.   Now hopefully it won™t get to that point.  We 
hope that as a matter of law on which we all 
agree, an individual who is the owner of securities of the nature he describes does not have sufficient status in law to bring such a lawsuit.  He doesn™t have sufficient standing.  He can™t separately identify injury to himself sufficient to enable 
or warrant a court undertaking a case or controversy here in the lawsuit. 7/19-20/76 - 14 - 
MR. BLACK.  Tom, does that 
case that was brought in Billings, Montana, years ago along these lines-- 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Bryant v. FOMC. 

MR. BLACK.  Didn™t that make 
essentially the same claim? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  It did.  He was holding a 
Federal Reserve note, a piece of currency, 
but he was making the same kind of 
noise with respect to its invalidity and demanding that he be 
given gold in place of it, and the court dismisse
d that on the same thesis that he hasn™t 
established a standing to bring the lawsuit.  Yes? 
MR. BALLES.  Is the complaint invalidated
 on one standing but supported on another standing of its government [unintelligible]? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, the answer is yes.  We
 have picked at both of his so-called bases for standing, [the other being] his membership in
 the House of Representatives and the role that 
he asserts he™s entitled to play.   Now there are multiple [court] decisions, probably 11 or so, that bear on this issue.  And 
we have cases such as [that of] Senator Kennedy, who brought such a lawsuit and was successful, the court holding that he did have st
anding.  But in each of those cases, we believe 
we can point specifically to the particular right that was involved as it related to an individual vote, either on statute or a proposed statute or on a confirmation of a Presidential 
appointee--some individual
 right that he had been deprived of.  We think much more nebulous 
and vague are the allegations of right, generally as a member
 of Congress, such as his participation in negotiations with the Senate on a confirmation of a Pr
esidential appointee.  Hopefully, that would be the downfall of the standing position.   Mr. Chairman, from the outset of your confer
ence conversation with the Presidents, we have been in almost daily touch with counsel 
at the New York Reserve Bank, whom we find to 
be representative of Reserve Bank counsel.  We 
had a meeting a week ago Friday with such 
counsel and the Department of Justice.  Subsequently, we exchanged initial drafts, pleadings, that we received from the New York Bank.  
We™ve also received communication from the 
Atlanta Bank and a communication from Minnea
polis.  We are working closely with these 
gentlemen.  We™re grateful for their help.   
We have another meeting scheduled Wednesday with Mr. Guy and Jim [unintelligible] 
coming down from New York.  And Ned Guy 
is acting at my re
quest to immediately communicate with the other Bank counsel exactly what
 our status is.  Hopefully, within the next three or four days we will complete what I hope 
will be an agreed position in final draft that we 
can circulate to all counsel for their comments 
and views.  Our time grows somewhat short now.  
I think we™re on pretty good schedule. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Tom, what
 are you going to do in this instance?  Merely argue on 
the point of standing, or do you go beyond that? 7/19-20/76 - 15 - 
MR. O™CONNELL.  At this time, the decisi
on hasn™t been made, and I™ll defer to a meeting with all counsel.  I can give you my own j
udgment, and that is that we are better served 
at the outset to combine a challenge to the standi
ng of the plaintiff to bring the lawsuit and to 
place before the District Court, on the merits, our
 challenge to the invalidity of the constitutional 
issue raised in the complaint.   
Hopefully, we will move to dismiss for failure
 to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted on the merits and hope to show the court, 
with whatever rationale we finally adopt, that [even] accepting everything he says to be true, th
ere is no constitutional law issue involved.  That 
the appointive process of the Presidents compor
ts fully with article II, section 2 of the Constitution, and hopefully we™ll be able to clea
rly [relate] both the provisions and the court 
decisional law that support this position.   And perhaps we will secondarily add an article 
that says, even if that isn™t true, in the 
alternative, [we have] the history of the so-called constitutional provision enabling Congress to itself delegate since the First National Bank Act.
  We had a history of functional performance by 
the First National Bank, the Second National Bank, down through the National Banks themselves, to this FOMC--a function that may 
sufficiently partake of current FOMC type of 
activity to support an allegation that this does not involve in any respect a challenge to executive appointment power.  That it™s congressional passag
e and that it™s totally consistent that Congress itself has by statute, by section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act, given to the FOMC the authority that historic [unintelligible] started with th
e First National Bank.   Now this is an argument that has been deve
loped in a rather lengthy paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  We haven™t [yet] agr
eed that it would be a supportive argument.  At 
this time, [our] briefs take the 
sole position that looking directly at article II, section 2, the composition, the functioning, the appointed process,
 and the process of the FOMC comports and is consistent with that clause.  And that is a result we hope to establish to the court™s satisfaction.  The plaintiff has not raised a valid claim upon 
which relief can be granted and we ask for a dismissal. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Tom, let me just pursue 
this question of procedure.  Assuming that 
you proceed in this fashion, then what ar
e the alternatives before the court? MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, if we proc
eed in the manner I™ve described, namely, 
that [we file] a motion to dismiss based on standi
ng and in the alternative on the merits issue, a 
court can dismiss for failure of th
e plaintiff to have standing to be before the court.  Finished. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  And may I say, that™s one of
 the reasons I am urging that we give 
very serious consideration to including in our moti
on to dismiss the merits issue, namely, to give 
the court a sense or flavor that, ﬁIf I don™t dismis
s on the challenge to standing and it goes to the merits, it looks as though there™s ‚color of right™ 
in the defendants.  They might win.ﬂ  On the 
other hand, [with] that same feeling that the cour
t might receive from seeing our statement on the 
merits, it can say, ﬁI can dismiss with clear c
onscience because I believ
e they would win.  And from what they™ve shown me, they would.  So I™m
 not depriving the plaintiff here of anything.  7/19-20/76 - 16 - 
I™ll dismiss on the standing issu
e, won™t take up the merits, and I can do so with [good] 
conscience because I think the plainti
ff would have lost on the merits.ﬂ 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  You present your case. MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, sir. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now what about the plaintiff?  Is he
 finished now? MR. O™CONNELL.  No. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Can he present counterarguments? 

MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes sir, and he will.  When
 we file on or before the 30th of July, whatever our response of pleading is, he has a stated number of days thereafter to file a reply 
pleading. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Do you have the opportunity to respond once again? MR. O™CONNELL.  It depends on the nature of th
at [reply].  I would suspect that we do.  He will file a motion, I would suspect for summa
ry judgment.  And accompanying that with-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion for 
summary judgment means--? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I™m sorry, Mr. Chairma
n, a motion for summary judgment is 
somewhat more broad than a motion to dismiss.  It
 more directly encompasses an approach as to 
some of the merits of the issue.  On the 
basis of his complaint, and whatever further 
documentation he [attaches to] this ne
w pleading, called a motion for summary judgment--perhaps affidavits, perhaps an affidavi
t of an economist suppor
ting the allegations of the original complaint--he would ask the court as
 a matter of law to declare that his cause of 
action is valid and that no judicial issue of fact exists--he would as
k the court to decide this as a 
matter that he™s entitled to judgment.  And that
 is exactly what the motion for summary judgment 
would do.   If it™s granted by the District Court, then a judgment is rendered with costs for the plaintiff.  On the other hand, if that motion is denied, he still
 has a complaint before the court, and with our 
motion to dismiss being denied and their moti
on for summary judgment being denied, we would 
then be obliged to file a total answer to the co
mplaint as originally filed, with answers to each 
allegation. We would deny the allegation of paragraph 6 and answer on the contrary, A, B, C; deny the allegation of [paragraph] 7.  The only thing we would probably admit is that it™s called 
the Federal Open Market Committee, and I thi
nk that admission could be safely made.   
Mr. Chairman, once that™s done, ﬁthe issues are 
joinedﬂ is the saying that is used, and the court would then set a given date for trial of those issues, and the complaint would go to trial. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now wait, trial mean
s that there will 
be oral pleadings? MR. O™CONNELL.  Trial means that th
ere will be oral testimony, yes. 7/19-20/76 - 17 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oral testimony by a
ttorneys or attorneys and witnesses? MR. O™CONNELL.  A little bit of
 both, I suspect.  The plaintiff has said that he would bring in economists and finance 
and market people to establish 
the validity of some of his 
complaint as to loss of value and so fort
h.  [The response we make] would await our 
understanding and our knowledge as to what his 
principal case and chief [unintelligible] would 
be.   I describe this, Mr. Chairman, only in response 
to your inquiry as to what would happen.  I would like to believe that this case will never get to
 that point.  I believe that with well-written 
briefs and memoranda of law and support of our
 motion, this case will go off on pleadings on the motions and on oral argument.  We will ask for or
al argument, and the court will set a date upon 
which the motions that I™ve been discussing would be heard orally, and at that time the plaintiff™s 
counsel and your counsel would be given an opportunity, usually 15 to 20 minutes, to argue 
orally the points made in our written pleas. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Yes? 

SPEAKER(?).  Just one question?  Tom, in 
the telephone conference a question was raised [unintelligible] and your answer, as I remember, was that [there is] enough time to bring in 
outside counsel.  It might be a
dvisable later, [unintelligible]. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  That was the gi
st of my answer, yes, Dave. 
SPEAKER(?).  How would outside counsel be 
brought in later once the position has been 
established?  You shift [unintelligible] 
away the ground leeway 
[unintelligible].  MR. O™CONNELL.  All right, fine
.  I think that in the Buckley v. Valeo case, which is the principal case cited by the plaintiff as the basis for his suit, the s
ubstance of law that the Supreme 
Court adopted was that found in the Supreme Co
urt briefs, not as extracted or drawn from 
whatever pleadings that were made in the Distri
ct Court or even in the Court of Appeals.   I think Archibald Cox and those who participat
ed at the Supreme Court level in writing the 
briefs probably had the greatest impact on the Court.  As a result of the action at the District 
Court level, we [may] start our
 appeal process through a three- judge court or a single-judge Court of Appeals and perhaps later a nine-judge Court of Appeals reconsideration, and then to the Supreme Court.  I think that 
at any one of those four stages [unintelligible] the opportunity [exists] to bring in a constitutional law expert if that is what is then necessary.   
It™s quite possible that the case could have tu
rned off on a procedural motion that doesn™t 
have the smack of constitutional law.  And to 
overweigh it now--with the thrust and import of outside counsel giving the apparent feeling that we think that enough substance is raised in that complaint on the constitutional law issue that we 
brought in Archibald Cox to write [that] small 
portion of the memorandum--I think would be a mi
stake.  He gives it too much color of substance and validity at this stage.  
Later I think far more [unintelligible]. 
7/19-20/76 - 18 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™m glad to see th
at attorneys pay attention to psychological factors, something that economists are beginning 
to do.  Any other question or comment?  Yes, 
Mr. Balles. 
MR. BALLES.  Tom, I was wondering whether anyone 
had found out whether the lawyer representing Reuss is doing so in his capacity as, well, a private lawyer for a private client, or is he on the staff of the Banking Committee, or just what? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  He™s on the staff of the Banking Committee, John.  He™s operating as 
best I can tell at the cost of the plaintiff, although his salary to the best of my knowledge continues as a member of that staff.  When I say co
sts, certain fees that had 
to be paid were to the best of my knowledge paid by Mr. Reuss.  But 
also, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Crews 
continues as a member of the staff drawing a salar
y.  At some point it may come out that the time 
he utilized in preparation of the plaintiff™s case was time that should have gone to the staff 
committee.  I haven™t raised the inquir
y, nor have I asked anyone to do so. MR. BALLES.  Well, I was 
wondering whether you thought-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think it™s very wise not to raise that question, but if you incidentally discover these facts, just file them
 away for some use I can™t anticipate.  But it 
would be useful to know the answer to that question.  Let™s not pursue it in any deliberate manner. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I think maybe 
John had a different question. MR. BALLES.  Well, no, I was simply going to ask, if 
it turned out that what you™ve heard is in fact true, that his salary is being pa
id by the committee, whether that might offer any 
opportunity for us to sort of complain to othe
r members of the committee and raise the issue of 
the use of his time. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I think it might as a matter of total-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Members of that comm
ittee are giving some thought to that 
possibility--some members--but I 
have not raised that question, and I™m not going to.  I think it 
would be a mistake.  It™s a question that obvi
ously arises really in 
the minds of different 
individuals, and that thought has already been conveyed to me. MR. O™CONNELL.  Better brought by them than us. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Exactly--oh no. 
MR. BALLES.  If I may, Tom, I just have 
one other question.  Could you share with us any impressions you have as to the caliber of the 
particular individuals from [the Department of] 
Justice that will be arguing this ca
se?  I understand they will carry 
the ball in court rather than 
you.  Is that the way it works out, or what? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  If standard operating pr
ocedure obtains, that will be the case, President Balles.  The counsel is one Vincent Tu
rlep.  On Friday, he argued the much publicized 
7/19-20/76 - 19 - 
case involving an Army sergeant 
that the Army, as you know, has been trying to dismiss from 
the service because of his status in the Army 
community.  That came to oral argument Friday 
before Judge Gessell.  Mr. Turlep argued against 
the plaintiff™s position and won in a ruling from 
the bench.  And I heard from another lawyer
 that he had done an excellent job.   We™ve had two lengthy meetings with him, 
and at the last meeting, Ned Guy and Jim [Oltman] were present.  I think he acquits himsel
f very well.  He has a penchant for listening.  He identifies issues that he doesn™t understand, and I think he drew heavily on Jim and Ned and on 
us a bit for some descriptive an
alysis of what he didn™t understand.  He™s asked some very 
pointed questions, and he™s very mu
ch interested in this lawsuit.  Those are about the only factors or characteristics I can give you.  He™s a young man. MR. BALLES.  Sounds promising. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  Been with the Department
 I think for four years and has handled some very important cases for the Department. 
MR. BALLES.  Good. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 
 How much help does a fellow like that get 
[unintelligible]? MR. O™CONNELL.  How much help?  Not a 
great deal, only because he has 40 other cases assigned to him, at least that used to be
 the way it was when I was there.  He™s got one secretary and two other attorneys in the room with him.  It™s 
sort of an impacted working condition.  And he tries to scramble for help.  I 
know a week ago Friday night, when I wanted to get a draft of some material over 
to him, I went over at 8 p.m. 
and he was still there working.  Had a girl [to help] him, but he 
said he brought her in from one of the other agencies, a friend of 
his wife™s.  So-- MR. O™CONNELL.  We made it very clear to him 
that if at any point in time he has any 
need of secretarial or [copying help] or any materi
al like that, call me day 
or night and we™ll get it done.  And the reverse is true, too. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions or comments? 
SPEAKER(?).  One question on timing [unintelligible].  What kind of time, Tom, is 
involved in possible [unintelligible]. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  It could come on July 30.  If
 the court said, ﬁI want to hear this motion right now,ﬂ that won™t be the case.  After we file our motion, as I indicated, he has time, 
say 10 days, within which to file his reply.  The court would then set a calendar date for oral argument.  [Although] the court could say ﬁI won™
t hear oral argument on this, and you™ll hear 
from me when I™ve reached a d
ecision,ﬂ that™s not likely to be the case.  And depending on the summer calendar of this particular judge, once he gets a portion of the summer cases out of the way, he may say, ﬁI don™t want to hear argument un
til September,ﬂ when the fall term begins.  It 
could be between now and the first of September. 
7/19-20/76 - 20 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What do you know about this judge, Tom, that has a bearing on 
the outcome? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I™ve made some inquiry.  
I have run across a group of lawyers that work with him on a judicial conference committee. 
 They™ve indicated that he has a penchant for inquiry with respect to issues he doesn™t understand.  No one opined on his level of receptivity to complicated issues.  I have some 
concern [unintelligible] on some of
 the statement of issues that 
are raised by this article II, section 2; we have to be very careful how we word our pleading.   Mr. Chairman, in all honesty, I know nothing advers
e in terms of his approach to issues of 
law or his tolerance of counsel and presentation of views in the pleading.  So hopefully, we have a judicial mind who will approach this in
 a very judicial manner.  Hopefully. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, a motion to 
adjourn would be welcomed by the chair. 
SPEAKER(?).  I move we adjourn. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  A motion has been
 made.  Any objection?  All right. 
[End of executive session] 
July 20, 1976 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we will get 
under way now, please.  We need to act 
first of all on the minutes of the June meeting. 
 Any problem with regard to the minutes?  Is 
anyone bold enough to move that the minutes 
be approved?  The motion has been made, 
presumably seconded, no objections are being rais
ed, so therefore we™re ready for Mr. Pardee, who will instruct us on foreign currency movements. 
MR. PARDEE.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  I understood Ital
y will repay part of its debt to us in a 
few days.  Is that correct? MR. PARDEE.  That™s right, this Thursday.  An exchange of cables has been made.  And 
we fully expect them to repay the othe
r [unintelligible] at least by maturity. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Good, any questions? MR. JACKSON.  Is the Mexican situation stable?  What are the prospects there? 
MR. PARDEE.  Yes, well, the Mexican situatio
n is stable, but it hasn™t turned [out] as 
favorably as they had hoped.  They had the large outflows at Easter time,
 occasionally drawing on us, and then several newspaper articles in the U.S. suggested they might devalue, which 
halted the usual reflows after the Easter period.  Now the outflow from Mexico has slowed, but 
there is still a steady drip drip of outflows.  They™ve passed their election period, they have their new President, but there remain
s a lack of a reflow to-- 7/19-20/76 - 21 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Has the new president been inaugurated? MR. PARDEE.  He will be inaugurated on December 1, and most of the people in the 
financial community are counting every day until that is done. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean they f
ear damage before he takes office? 
MR. PARDEE.  Well, they™ve lost confidence 
in the current President, and there are 
serious labor negotiations that are under way now.  The talk is of 15-25 percent wage increases, which could seriously undercut all of their efforts at this
 stage to restore stability. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, Mr. Wallich, please. 

MR. WALLICH.  I wonder, Mr. Chairman, wh
ether I should report on the gold discussion [at the Bank for International Settlements] in Basel. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, this might be 
very timely in view of what happened 
yesterday, and more so today, in the gold market
.  Perhaps before we do that, would someone 
report on precise movement on the price of gold. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, when gold-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Down to $110 is it? 
MR. WALLICH.  It™s now $105-$106 in the af
ternoon market, between
 the two figures. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh yeah?  Let no one sa
y that prices do not move down.  All right, 
Mr. Wallich, please. 
MR. WALLICH.   We received the report th
at had been agreed on in central bank negotiations on gold sales.  The way the BIS handles this is that the general manager of the BIS 
gets full information on quantities and prices, and 
I asked him to give us assurance that he has 
received that in the form agreed on, which he gave.  He passes this on in the form of a table that 
contains considerably less information but is 
nevertheless more complete than most of those 
present anticipated; we have country detail on who sold or bought what.   Very little actually seems to have gone on in
 the market.  The French and the Swiss both 
bought a ton in the IMF auction, through the BIS, and assuming the report to be complete, that 
seems to be all they bought.  Th
e largest seller at the auction, 
other than the IMF, was Canada, which sold for the purpose of [unintelligible] medals or coins. 
As a result of these sales, there is now a l
eeway under the ceiling, that
 is to say, by virtue 
of the G-10 agreement, a central bank would be 
allowed to buy as much as 35.2 tons. To get the 
dollar value, you have to multiply by $4 [million] at
 the price that prevailed a few days ago and 
by something more nearly [like] $3 [million] at 
the price that prevails today, $3 million per ton, 
approximately.  In other words, the ceil
ing is on the order of $120 million now.   
7/19-20/76 - 22 - 
Well, there was general approval of this, an expression of gratification that the report was 
complete.  I had to note that some things seemed to
 be not fully stated, and there is in that report 
evidence that one has to watch carefully what 
information one is given.  But I think there™s 
goodwill to supply the data correctly, and so far not
hing [unintelligible] seems to have happened. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What did you learn about prices?  Prices charged by the BIS to the 
central banks which purchased gold.  I-- MR. WALLICH.  Yes. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --I don™t mean detailed, 
but what percent did the price deviate 
from the auction price? 
MR. WALLICH.  The price at which the BIS 
sold to Switzerland and France was the same 
as the auction price.  On the other BIS sales,
 they didn™t tell us.  However, from public 
sources--that is, leaks--we did know roughly what the bidding pattern was; namely, the BIS, and 
possibly the Swiss National Bank, had spread out a considerable volume of bids in such a way as 
to, in effect, support the price had there been pure bids from the ma
rket.  It turned out that this tail of [unintelligible] bids not accepted was fairly close to the market price.  This is something 
that we extracted at the meeting 
and [unintelligible] was present there, said that they were going to publish the price of the bidding pattern without names, which 
they™ve done.  I don™t have it here now. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it™s very interes
ting, up to a point even instructive.  Thank you very much.  Any questions? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes? 

MR. BAUGHMAN.  This may be an inappropria
te question.  Is it expected that the IMF will continue to sell gold almost
 irrespective of price trend, or
 will the IMF™s volume of sales 
likely be determined by the price trend? 
MR. WALLICH.  The agreement is for regular 
auctions.  The next auction is to be on September 15, I believe.  There was at the [uni
ntelligible] meeting not among the Governors, at 
least not that I heard, but at the level of the BIS Committ
ee on Gold and Foreign Exchange, which Scott Pardee attends, there™s some pre
ssure for postponement of the auction on the 
grounds that the market was saturated and the sale
s had not been fully absorbed.  Well, the price 
pattern since that time doesn™t seem
 to contradict that statement, 
but the U.S. position is that gold sales should continue on a regular schedule. MR. MACLAURY.  How might th
e LDC™s [less-developed countries] feel about that issue?  They must be-- 
MR. WALLICH.  They have to lose on account 
of the trust fund, and even more, Italy and 
Portugal, whose main resource and [whose] present 
difficulty is their substantial gold stock, are of course involved.  The [BIS] may be concerned about their collateral under the Italian loan, 7/19-20/76 - 23 - 
which is at a level now above the market.  With 
respect to their Portuguese [unintelligible], they have a margin call facility, that
 is, a maintenance-of-value clause for that collateral. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I might just
 comment with respect to the Mexican 
situation as observed along the borders, so to speak.  We see no letup in the demand for large-
denomination U.S. currency. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any large denomination currency [unintelligible]. 

MR. BAUGHMAN.  Pardon me? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any large denominati
on currency left in the Dallas Bank? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  I can™t answer that explicitly as of today, but we are shipping.   They™re taking it up primarily from El Paso, however
, to Dallas.  We have recently drawn from 
another Federal Reserve District 
a substantial volume which is be
ing transferred to Mexico.  We 
continue to hear reports of substantial purchases of real estate 
by Mexican nationals, and also the banks [unintelligible] despite that are recording rather phenomenal
 increases in time and savings 
deposits attributed in part to Mexicans. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  [Unintelligible] confused these purchases of real estate.  Where 
are they taking place, in Mexic
o, or in the U.S., or both? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Those that I™m heari
ng about are taking place in Texas. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right now, Mr. Pardee, do you have any recommendations to the Committee? 
MR. PARDEE.  Yes, painfully.  We have 
the remaining $82.4 million equivalent of the 
Belgian franc drawing coming up to the 20th rene
wal for their [unintelligible].  We™ve made 
good progress on this one, and with any luck we might even be able to repay the full amount 
within the next three months.  On that basi
s I recommend renewal.  The Swiss franc swap 
drawings in the amount of $1.1472 billion are 
also up for their 20th renewal on August 13.  Although the Swiss franc rate has stabilized, it is
 still at an exceedingly high rate, and I see no 
immediate prospect of our beginning to acquire significant [unintelligible].  I recommend 
renewal there, too. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™ve heard the reco
mmendations, and what is the will of the 
Committee-- 
SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

SPEAKER(?).  Seconded. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The recommendations
 made by the Manager, hearing no objections, are approved.  We also need to confir
m the transactions that have taken place at the 
Desk.  Is there a motion to approve and confirm? 
7/19-20/76 - 24 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion made seconde
d, no objection.  Let™s hear from Mr. 
Reynolds.   MR. REYNOLDS.  [Secretary's note: This st
atement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you Mr. Reynolds.  Any questions? MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, Mr. Wallich. 
MR. WALLICH.  When you try 
to anticipate the possible m
ovement of the dollar--you 
mentioned interest rates and the 
current account--do you regard [unintelligible] rates of inflation as an additional separable factor or is that sort of factored into the current account expectation? MR. REYNOLDS.  Well, I think it™s only partly factored into the current account expectation.  I guess I don™t want to be very firm about an exch
ange rate prediction.  We know remarkably little about it.  But the dollar on a 
weighted average basis has been really rather 
steady for quite a long while now, and it™s just that at the moment we haven™t got reason to 
imagine that that stability will be upset soon. 
MR. WALLICH.  Thank you. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions or comments?  Very well, let™s turn to the 
domestic economy.  Mr. Gramley. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  [Secretary's not
e: This statement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  [Unintelligible] Mr. Gr
amley, and thanks to you, Mr. Zeisel.  I 
think we ought to have now a discussion of the condition of the economy and the outlook, and let 
us defer consideration of alternative monetary 
policy until we turn to the next subject, namely 
our longer-term targets.  Who would like to 
comment on the economy?  In particular, you ought 
to be emphasizing, or calling attention to, or 
questioning factual observations and a little 
comment made by Mr. Zeisel.  Mr. Wallich. 
MR. WALLICH.  I™m puzzled
 by the great steadiness, quarter by quarter, that you anticipate for real GNP growth.  It goes at a rate of 5 percent.  First, it seems not very likely that 
this degree of stability can be maintained.  Second, I™m puzzled by the relatively low rate of 
growth, which is considerably below what I would have thought the economy might be doing.  I 
ask myself what are the ingredients 
of this forecast.  I realize that it™s partly the model, which is 
geared to a rate of money supply growth that will 
come out at that rate in
 the very long run, but I take it that™s not decisive here.  This is in good part judgmental.   
And what I™d like to hear is--given that there are a number of 
elements in the GNP that are 
not strong now, like housing, business fixed investme
nt, and even inventory, even state and local government--there seems to be more room on the upside for things to accelerate than on the 

downside.  Is that a reasonable view? 7/19-20/76 - 25 - 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, those are quite a few 
questions all wrapped up in one, Governor Wallich.  Let me try to answer in [unintelligible].
  Obviously, we don™t really expect the rate of 
real GNP to be 5 percent every quarter.  And if it were to come out that way, no one would be 
more amazed than the staff.  It just doesn™t ha
ppen.  I do think, though, that the situation we face 
now could easily develop into a prolonged period of relatively steady expansion in real output.  I have been struck by the sim
ilarities in many respects that this expansion [bears to] the 
expansion of 1960-61.  Let me recite for you what
 happened during that period.  After the first year of recovery, real GNP growth
 in the second year of recovery rose 6-1/2 percent; in the third 
year of recovery, 3-1/4 percent; in the fourth year, 6 percent; the fifth year of recovery was 5 [percent].  Now that sort of pattern is one that I think would be unlikely to develop in the current recovery if we have the continuation of relatively balanced expansion which seems to be going 
on now.   I do not regard a 5 percent growth rate after the first year of
 recovery as low.  On the contrary, if you look back at [uni
ntelligible] experience, what you find is that the second year of 
recovery typically finds the real GNP growth rate falling by about half, about 8 [percent] to 4 [percent].  Once you lose that tremendous 
thrust from the turnaround in inventory 
investment--from deep liquidation to accumulation
--it™s quite common for th
e growth rate to be 
slow.   Whether or not the potential for overrun is greater than the potential for an underrun of this projection, I™m not at this juncture
 sure.  We have projected a ve
ry sizable expansion of business fixed investment for the period immediately ah
ead.  For example, the projection we™re making 
on plant and equipment expenditure year over year 
for 1977 is a little over 20 percent.  That™s a fairly heroic projection at this stage of the game, and I can easily 
see possibilities that plant and equipment spending did not build up that kind of st
eam, so I think there are real possibilities for 
an undershoot as well as for an overshoot. MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, please sir, may I 
ask that you read the first two or three sentences of your report, just as a lead-in because-- MR. ZEISEL.  ﬁThe [unintelligible] of busin
ess activities slowed perceptibly [from a] 
rapid rate earlier this year.  Preliminary 
GNP estimates for the se
cond quarter are being released.ﬂ  MR. ROOS.  I have the feeling in listening to this that th
e lead-in has a rather negative ring to it and that everything that you referred to [later] in your report and Mr. Gramley™s remarks are 
much more positive. 
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, I was star
ting off with a flat statement that reflected the numbers 
[unintelligible] suggest that I thought that things were mode
rating from an unsustainably higher 
rate to quite a healthy balanced expansion in the economy. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you.  Mr. Black, please. MR. BLACK.  Has this reduction--4.4 percent growth in real GNP in the second quarter from the assumed 5 percent rate--changed your f
eeling about the rest of the year?  I know you 
7/19-20/76 - 26 - 
haven™t probably had a chance to run all of your simulations.  I gather from what you said this 
probably wouldn™t change.  I-- MR. GRAMLEY.  I would regard the 4-1/2 percent estimate that came up today and our 
5 percent estimate as equivalent.  We can™t come
 anything like that clos
e to approximating what 
is happening in the economy.  I would remind you 
also that these figures are still preliminary. 
SPEAKER(?).  Oh sure. 

MR. GRAMLEY.  We do not have June inve
ntory figures yet.  The basic difference between the actual figures and our projection is that inventory investment went down a little in 
the second quarter rather than up a little as we had projected.  I wouldn™t consider that as being anything which would require a modification in any way. 
MR. BLACK.  And my second question.  You™ve
 assumed less upward pressure on interest 
rates than you were assuming in June, presumably because of a high assumed level of money 

supply.  And yet looking at growth in domestic
 investment, and specifi
cally fixed investment, 
you have revised this downward from what you were projecting in June.  I was a bit puzzled as to why, because we now have a few more indications of strength in business spending on capital than we had this time last year. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  We™ve made only very, very 
minor adjustments in our projection of 
business fixed investment.  The news as I interp
ret it has been relatively neutral over the past months.  We had the new orders [data] a month a
go, and I reported that, too, as I recall.  I don™t know that anything very decisive is coming one wa
y or another, and it was not our intention to make any significant modification of th
e business fixed investment projection. 
MR. BLACK.  But it is large. I was just 
puzzled by the direction of it because the Greenbook summary seemed to [emphasize] an 
improved outlook; on page I-2, that last paragraph--that looks more favorable than
 anything we™ve seen other than that. MR. GRAMLEY.  I think that the Greenbook st
atement had to do generally with the 
improvement in the outlook over a 
longer period rather than the outlook over this past month. MR. BLACK.  What I™m talki
ng about really is the downward revision of your figures over the next four quarters. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What was the revision, Lyle? 

MR. GRAMLEY.  As I remember, Mr. Chairman, 
the revision in our projection is very minor. 
MR. BLACK.  It is not particularly large, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What was it down, Lyle? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Pardon me?  
7/19-20/76 - 27 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Did you reduce the estimate
, and if so, what were the factors that led you to that projection? MR. BLACK.  It™s a $4.3 billion reduction, Mr. Chairman, in the second quarter of next 
year, from what they were projecting in the 
last Greenbook.  And a good part of this is in business fixed investment, which is revised dow
nward from 193 to 189.5.  I was just curious as 
to what your thinking might be on that.  It now looks
 a little more solid to me than it did at that 
time.  Maybe I™m reading too much significance into
 small changes.  I guess it™s the direction 
rather than the magnitude, because certainl
y, if we left it in, the range of error-- 
MR. GRAMLEY.  The business fixed investment
 figures from the second quarter of 1972 through the first quarter of 1975 show increases this time of about a ha
lf a billion a quarter, at an annual rate, lower than before.  The [reason for the] downward revision th
ere was basically that the shipment figures that were coming in duri
ng the second quarter were slightly lower but 
[unintelligible] off a bit.   We did add more into business fixed investme
nt in the second quarter of 1977, and then continued fairly strong expansion in the latter half of that year.  I don™t regard this as at all a significant alteration.  It still implies an increase in bus
iness fixed investment plant and equipment expenditures year over year consider
ably exceeding that projected in the last 
Commerce survey.  I believe the figure we have 
is between 9 and 9-1/2 percent.  And then a year-over-year increase on a survey 
basis next year [unintelligible]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think there may be a lit
tle confusion here.  What we are talking 
about is an estimate of business fixed investment
 in the second quarter.  Oh, oh, well, I™m sorry, 
then I was confused.  I think Mr. Black has raised a fair question.  Why lower the projections?  
The fact that shipments declined
 is not a good reason.  If orders had declined that would be a good reason. MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I [unintelligible] 
really, this is over th
e next four quarters [unintelligible].  [For] that period, the projections made in June
 were above those made in July in 
the Greenbook.  I was really looking at the long runs.  I™m sorry 
I confused the issue by not specifying the--   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You didn™t confuse the issue, no, I was confused not by anything you said.  Well, I don™t think you™ve gotten a good answer so far. MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, I would repeat, Mr. 
Chairman, that this is such a minor 
adjustment in the projection of business fixed inve
stment that I don™t consider it significant.  I 
think our projection for business fixed investment is in the same 
ball park it was last time.   
Now, as to why we use shipments.  We have been looking very carefully at shipment 
figures recently because the shipment figures in th
e fourth quarter and again in the first quarter of this year were telling us things about business fixed investment wh
ich were in no other figures at all.  And I think in part this reflects the fact that 
the downturn this time was much sharper, and 
we didn™t get the cancellations that I would have anticipated, given that retrenchment 
[unintelligible].  But when these shipments bega
n coming back again, we began recording this in 
the business fixed investment projection. 
7/19-20/76 - 28 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I would differ on that judgment, but I think Mr. Gramley is 
certainly right in saying that the difference betwee
n the two figures, putting the direction aside, is 
minor. 
MR. BLACK.  I agree, it was mainly a matter 
of why the change in direction.  I realize that™s well within the range of long [unintelligible].  This puzzled me a bit, and I thought maybe I 
might see something I was overlooking. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Mr. Morris, let us hear from you now, please. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I have one co
mment and one question.  [My comment] is 
on this exercise of alternative policies.  I am not talking-- 
SPEAKER(?).  [Unintelligible.] 

MR. MORRIS.  --about monetary policies now, Mr. Chairman, I 
am trying to make a point 
about the usefulness of this as-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think that can be best considered wh
en we turn to the longer- range targets.  [What we are] considering now
 is the condition of the economy and economic 
prospects. MR. MORRIS.  Well, th
en, I™ll turn to my question, and 
that is, you gave an optimistic 
report on prices, but in the past couple of weeks [we have been] getting a very sharp increase in 
the weekly indexes of basic commodity prices, 
which I find difficult to jibe with the overall 
analysis, [as] all of our indicators [are suggestin
g] a decelerating rate of
 growth, and I wonder if you could help me on that score. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, the one th
ing that has disturbed us in our price projection is whether or not it™s consistent with what™s been happening to individual materials prices.  The increases in industrial prices th
at I™m using here, the BLS [unint
elligible] industrial price index, 
and the movements of these industrial prices are 
just all over the lot, so [unintelligible] we™ve 
seen increases much bigger in some previ
ous upswings than we™ve seen recently.   
But I would say that the increases
 are beginning to be worrisomely large.  Our view is that 
these increases will be accompanied by a picture 
for unit labor costs which reflects what™s been 
happening to compensation per man-hour as well 
as productivity and will keep unit labor costs rising in a range of around 5 percent.  Now, if you project a much larger increase in general price levels than we have, and if unit labor costs stay in that range, what you get is a rise in corporate profits [the size of] which we can™t believe.  It™s much larger than is characteristic of the second quarter of recovery.  And that was a principal factor leading us to the judgment that prices would 
stay about in line with the rise in labor costs.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Just to add an interpretative word, you have the extravagant increases in sensitive raw material prices.  A
nd that has been going on for some time, but the 
wage behavior is significantly better than one mi
ght have expected, and therefore the relatively optimistic price projection is not unreasonable.  
I would question it myself
, but I don™t think it™s 7/19-20/76 - 29 - 
unreasonable in view of recent wage behavior.  Th
at, of course, was contained in your reference 
to unit labor costs. MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, yes.  We do think that th
e rate of wage increase so far this year probably understates what will be going on for the 
year as a whole because this has been a period 
in which we have had a relatively light calendar of collective bargaining settlements.  And also 
the timing of deferred adjustments under existing cont
racts is such that they tend to bunch in the second half. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, any further comment or question, Mr. Morris? MR. MORRIS.  No. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Mr. Eastburn, please. MR. EASTBURN.  I would like to come back 
briefly to fixed capital investment.  The 
readings we got on a qualitative basis is that things are slow and cost less.  We don™t see any 
evidence that businessmen are really anxious to 
step up their investment, and this leads to a 
question, Lyle, as to what the basis is for that quite optimistic 
longer-run projection that you had.  Is it simply based on the normal cycl
es of spending in this phase or-- MR. GRAMLEY.  It™s based heavily on past ty
pical experience, [which is] that when you have a strong run-up in final sales, particularly
 consumer expenses, it does induce businesses to 
become more optimistic as time goes on.  It™s based on a strong profit performance, which we 

expect will continue; the results of our model point in this dire
ction.  We also think that the 
Commerce survey, because of the way bias [unint
elligible] to me, understated what has been 
happening to business planning.  The bias adjustment this time is negative-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Can you explain that, Lyle? MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, the Commerce Department
 adjusts its raw figures on anticipated 
plant and equipment spending for what they consider 
to be systematic biases that they see in the 
data.  This bias adjustment has a history to it
, a very large movement over the course of the 
years.  In the early years of the 1970s, Commer
ce was adding several billion dollars to its projected expenditures for plant and equipment to correct systematic bias.  This year they™re 
subtracting several million dollars. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You still haven™t explaine
d what systematic bias they have in 
mind. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  If they find certain indus
tries underestimating 
their expenditures regularly over a period of years, they will tend to
 adjust those expenditures upward.  If they find 
other industries systematically overestimating, thei
r expenditures, they adjust those expenditures downward. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  In other words, the systematic bias adjustment may really be a 
description of the past. 7/19-20/76 - 30 - 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, sir.  That™s right.  In 
this particular year, the bias is reducing anticipated expenditures by a couple of percentage points.  If you leave out that bias adjustment, 
what you get is an anticipated increase of around 9 percent.  And we think that-- CHAIRMAN BURNS. Do they publis
h the figures in both forms? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I am not aware that they pub
lish the unadjusted figures.  I don™t think the information is confidential, it is availabl
e to the public, but we get it over the telephone. MR. WALLICH.  Does that bias adjustme
nt differentiate between expansion and 
contraction? MR. GRAMLEY.  They try to make no allowa
nce for cyclical [unintelligible].  A deliberate effort is made to avoid adju
stment for the position of the cycle. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Could I follow that with one other question?  Suppose, Lyle, that this 
optimistic projection for fixed investment is t
oo optimistic.  Does this encourage you in the 
sustained expansion or does it mean that we might abort? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I wouldn™t wish to say that 
a downward revision in our projection of business fixed investment would lead to an aborti
on of the recovery.  It certainly would weaken it a great deal.  And [it] would get [us] into several [other] areas.  Our inventory projection is conditioned on the hypothesis that once you get a buildup in business fixed investment going for 
quite some time, it generates a rather large in
crease in materials and supplies in the durable 
goods industries.  Second, the induced consumption increase from the employment created by 
rising business fixed investment is also an 
important element in keeping the growth of 
[unintelligible] strong.  So you™d have weakenin
g in all three of these areas, but depending on how much you adjusted the projec
tions downward, [it] mi
ght or might not lead to an abortion of 
the recovery. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Mr. Kimbrel now, please. 

MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, maybe I™m looki
ng through a different set of glasses, but I™d like to ask, along the same line, just 
how confident Mr. Gramley feels about these 
construction projections.  In our own case, you ask for specific examples, here are a couple.  A 
major utility that shelved a nuclear constructi
on project three years ago has recently announced 
the resumption of it at a much 
higher cost of construction.  And in the last couple of weeks, visiting with two of the larger builders in our area--one specializing in manufacturing plan
t construction and the other in industrial parks--the industrial builder said that within the la
st two months they had negotiated contracts for more construction 
work than they had in any previous two-year period in their entire existence.  The other indicated 
that they were no longer pricing bids reasonably, that they were adding  [to their bids] simply to 
miss the new contracts because they could not
 carry them out if they got them.   
So maybe these instances are enti
rely unique, but at least in visiting with those [businesses, we see] there is construction under way in our area, and I am just wondering how confident you 
feel about these construction projection figures. 7/19-20/76 - 31 - 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, President Kimbrel, I gue
ss if I had to express my concern about 
our overall projection of business fixed investment at this point, I 
would say that my concern lies 
in the direction, as President Eastburn suggested, that maybe there really isn™t enough evidence 
at this point to justify as strong a projection as we have.   We are basing it very heavily on the fact that past experience indicates that once [you get] a good increase in final sales capacity, utilization rates, and business profits under way, it does carry through to a strengthening of business fixed investment-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that plus relative ease in financial markets and a strong stock 
market are also propellin
g strong [unintelligible]. MR. GRAMLEY.  I think that-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  In other words, I think that you™ve got a good deal more to go on 
than past cyclical experience. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, my thought here, Mr. Ch
airman, is that we™ve got strong order 
figures for the first five months of the year; the figures on construction contract awards have been notably weak, and we see no really significant [unintelligible] up there; and rising new orders will carry you through for a couple of quarters but not much beyond that.  We really have 
to see some more basic signs of strengthening 
in the nonresidential construction area to be sure that we are going to get this emer
ging pattern we have projected. MR. EASTBURN.  I think this is very relevant to the long-run target, because if you have uncertainty in this vital area, it certainly has [unintelligible] implication for which way you go. MR. PARTEE.  Monroe, were these heavy construction-- 
MR. KIMBREL.  Yes. 
MR. PARTEE.  You™re talking in every case about heavy construction? 
MR. KIMBREL.  No, one is in industrial parks, but they are major industrial parks. 
MR. PARTEE.  I see. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  Mr. Partee now, please. MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I have th
ree comments.  On the pattern of current 
GNP numbers, I™ve noticed that ther
e tends to be a sort of zigzag.  We™ve had that before in the 
economy, with one quarter stronger, then one qua
rter relatively weaker.  Notably in the 1966, 1967, 1968 period.  I think one might want to look at
 the second quarter™s performance in light of 
averaging on the first quarter, and if you do that, you get pretty close to a 7 percent growth rate for the half year.  That is, 9-1/4 and 4-1/2 roughly would be close to a 7 percent average rate of increase, which was quite a satisfact
ory rate of real GNP growth.   7/19-20/76 - 32 - 
I understand that that™s dangerous because the first quarter had a lot of inventory turnabout, and you can™t reasonably predict that there would be that kind of contribution again in the second half of the year.  But nevertheless, I think some
 averaging is called for, and we ought to look at the figures for the half in that light.   
The second comment is that I agree with Mr. Roos that the outlook looks extraordinarily good, extraordinarily stable.  There is a lack of speculation, and yet I think that there is sort of a growing buildup of plans and expenditures in a variety of fields without the hazards of overspeculation that results in a cutback late
r on.  And I would remind the Committee of Mr. 
Reynolds™s presentation, which indicates that that™s not true just of the United States, that™s true 
of the world.  We™re getting moderate recovery in
 the world, whereas we don™t have any signs of speculation in capital or in inventory.   Yesterday, I happened to meet with a fellow fr
om Japan, and he commented that his people 
had been very badly burned in 1973-1974 with their inventory speculations.  And they are not going to repeat it.  They™ve learned a lesson, and they™re going to be very careful as far as making long future commitments for 
inventory of the kind that they have made before.  Well, I 
think that is the general attitude
 everywhere.  And I think that™s a point of strength, which I think is what Larry Roos, was saying, rather than weakness, in the whole outlook.   Now the third comment is, having said all of th
at, I still agree with 
Governor Wallich that 
the 5 percent average rate of increase in real GNP is rather disappointing over the next six quarters, and I say that even though Lyle is quite right that 5 percent isn™t bad historically.  The reason I say it is [disappointing] is that, with 7-1/2 percent unemployment and production in the 
materials producing industries at 80 percent 
of capacity, we™ve got room for a lot more 
expansion than a 5 percent average rate over the six quarters.   But I would also point out to the Committee that when you look at this projection, there are a couple of areas that seem to me
 a little on the weak side.  On
e is residential construction.  I can™t really believe that housing starts are going to increase only 60 thousand more at an annual 
rate from the current level and then peak.  And that
 is what the projection literally calls for.  Now 
I understand that that is due in part to the expectation that interest rates may rise.  But the increases in interest rates here aren™t really larg
e, and the standard projection and availability of mortgage finance is very good right now. And [unint
elligible] on that intere
st rate projection, if 
it™s a little high it would m
ean that you would have better inflows.  And I™m inclined to think that residential construction could come up apprecia
bly--not a boom, but appreciably higher than 
the 1.5 million to 1.550 million that is in the projection.   
The other thing that I would note is that government purchases 
of goods and services are in every quarter of the projection below the average rate of increase in nominal GNP.  Now it may 
well be that government purchases for the next 
six quarters will continue to be quite weak 
relative to the performance of the total economy. 
 But I think that all members of the Committee 
must recognize that there is at least a possibility 
that there will be greater strength in government 
purchases than is in this material, which I as
sume essentially projec
ts the official budget numbers, looking ahead. 
7/19-20/76 - 33 - 
MR. GRAMLEY.  No, no, our projections of 
federal expenditures for quite some time 
have been well above the Administ
ration projections.  We have a fe
deral outlays figure for fiscal 1977 of $410 billion; that compares with the 
congressional figure of $413 billion; and as I remember, the official Administration figure is 
$394 billion.  So, we have been well above the Administration figures. 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, if you look at federal pur
chases, the second quarter is 3.4, the third quarter is 6.5, and the fourth quarter is 12. MR. GRAMLEY.  It is a very moderate increase 

MR. PARTEE.  And then it drops back again, a very moderate increase.  
MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s what it wo
uld seem ought to be implied. 
MR. PARTEE.  I simply want to point out to
 the Committee that that is part of the 
projection.  And, therefore, I guess I think that there is a good chance that the growth rate will be more than 5 percent on average--looking over the six quarters--mor
e or less regardless of any small difference in monetary policy with [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS. Thank you, Mr. Partee.  Mr. Coldwell. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Part
ee asked my questions. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good.  Mr. Winn now please. 

MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, I™m afraid I™m su
ffering from data indigestion.  The new 
orders data, to what extent is that influenced by primary metals? 
 What™s the weight of primary 
metals in there, and to what extent is 
their price behavior distorting the figures? MR. GRAMLEY.  We don™t have an
 orders figure yet for June.  The price increases in this field have not yet been reflected in the new orders that we have at this point.  The only way I can think that the price factor would have gotten into this new orders figure is some anticipatory 
volume we have heard of that would have raised
 new orders for primary metals somewhat.  Now 
so far as the weight is concerned, in durable goods industries, primary metals is about 9 billion 
[unintelligible].  MR. WINN.  What, about 10 percent? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yeah. 

MR. WINN.  Not about 20, not 18 percent or more? 

MR. GRAMLEY.  We have had a good run-off in 
the primary metals industry, in part the 
consequence of the fact that inventories of durable materials generally were run down, and now 
we are at the stage of this cycle where that™s in 
the process of being reversed.  Some of this is a 
genuine increase [unintelligible]. 7/19-20/76 - 34 - 
MR. WINN.  Our second problem, Mr. Chairma
n, is what™s our productivity assumptions 
in the model?  Three percent, is th
at what you™ve got in there, or-- MR. ZEISEL.  Well, it™s model 
projections, Governor.  These are judgmental projections, 
and the average over the next six quarters is slightly under 3 percent.  It tapers down, however, very slightly in a-- MR. WINN.  Now, is that built 
into the projection?  It™s not
 in the model, as I understand 
it? MR. GRAMLEY.  It™s in the projection. 

MR. ZEISEL.  In this system, that is the number that we come up with. 

MR. WINN.  As I understand the models, they 
show rather weird pr
oductivity assumptions 
for the period ahead. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, productivity estimates by the econometric model have been 
considerably off for a long period.  That is, if th
e model suggests that we ought to have a more 
rapid [unintelligible] productivity, then we judgmenta
lly believe it will occur.  But it™s been off for so long that even the modelers themselves don™t trust it. 
MR. PARTEE.  What did you say, Jerr
y, that it™s 15 down to 3 percent? MR. ZEISEL.  No, we figure a rate of increase 
in the second half of ™76 of about a little over 3 percent, and it drifts down to a 2-3/4 percent rate by about the end of ™77. MR. PARTEE.  Under 3 percent? 
MR. ZEISEL.  Under the 3 percent.  This is nonfarm productivity--th
e long-term trend is 
about 2-1/2.  It remains slightly [
unintelligible], and seems to us c
onsistent with a rate of growth in real GNP and real activity that is somewhat above that. 
MR. WINN.  The third data problem I have is
 with our weekly reporting banks.  I wonder how characteristic that is in te
rms of the total bank data.  The Federal Trade Commission data 
would show an upturn in loans, you know, and the total bank data show  a downturn.  You start to examine the weekly reporting in the total a
nd you get some really weird data behavior. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  One of the long-standing charact
eristics of the FTC centers is that they 
never performed any [unintelligible] to dig out 
of the banking data.  Now the weekly reporting 
banks are a long ways from the al
l-commercial-banking ma
terials that we get.  [Unintelligible] estimates of what™s going on is banks from whic
h we do not get recent reports and indeed from 
which we don™t actually have good loan data except for Call Report dates.  In general, what happens is that the larger banks show much larg
er cyclical slants in business loans than do the 
smaller banks.  The smaller banks can have a mo
re steady rise and are often experiencing very substantial loan expansions when loan demands [elsewhere] are quite weak. 
7/19-20/76 - 35 - 
MR. WINN.  I apologize for 
indigestion on some of these things.  One comment, and 
Governor Jackson probably is in a better position to comment than I am, but when you look at 
the vacancy rate and some increase in rents, 
I think you can take some encouragement on the 
multiple housing prospects, at least for next year. 
 There is an interesting institutional barrier to 
that, which is the fact that the savings banks and the insurance companies are very reluctant to go 
back into this market, even though th
ere are some other attractive deals. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  So are commercial banks. 

MR. WINN.  Commercial
 banks go if the others go in on the construction; there™s money 
there. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This rece
nt banking survey [indicates they] have no interest in 
multifamily housing. 
MR. WINN.  Yeah, I think this is true of sa
vings banks and insurance companies, and yet the economics are starting to look much more favorable. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  They look more favorable, but these fellows have had bad experience. 
MR. WINN.  Yeah, they™ve been burned. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Badly burned. 
MR. WINN.  The other interesti
ng thing is that while the si
ngle-family homes are starting 
to price themselves out of the market, the ma
nufactured home, which is the successor to the 
trailer and the mobile home, r
eally looks like it might have 
a bigger potential with the $20 thousand to $30 thousand developments showing up here in this area.  And so I think there are 
some plus factors showing up here to a
lter our outlook in some of these areas. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That reinfo
rces Mr. Partee™s observation. MR. PARTEE.  What do you m
ean by manufactured homes? 
MR. WINN.  It™s the mobile home adaptation. 

MR. PARTEE.  --another half a house. MR. WINN.  And they got away from the box 
idea.  They™ve got artificial basements to 
put in. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s a double box. 
MR. PARTEE.  An artificial basement. 

MR. WINN.  Yeah, yeah, it™s unb
elievable, some of the th
ings they do.  And they™re getting away from the trailer park idea, and th
ey™re putting them on larger
 lots.  And this is altering-- 
7/19-20/76 - 36 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What does an
 artificial basement mean? 
MR. WINN.  It™s boxed in at th
e bottom so it looks like there 
is a basement, and it doesn™t 
look like it™s on a block, like those today. MR. GRAMLEY.  Mr. Chairman, may I just poin
t out that in our own staff projection, we have allowed some moderate increases in the mu
ltifamily starts area.  I think that the Committee 
should be aware that there are some negative cons
iderations in the single-family area also.  The 
sales of existing houses have not risen since late last year.  Sales of new houses, if anything, are declining now.  [Unintelligible.]  We don™t have the underlying
 demand for single-family homes, 
[that] I think [is needed] to send the single-family starts up to
 a very high level. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  How good ar
e these figures on sales? MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, they are a relatively ne
w series.  I don™t know that we have any basis for evaluating this series. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  How good a sample? 

MR. GRAMLEY.  That I don™t know.  I 
don™t have any information on that. MR. JACKSON.  Believe or disbelieve.  I think the most interesting comment I™ve heard 
recently about rents and multifamily construction was from Baltimore this past week from a 

guest at lunch, Mr. Meyerhoff, who™s very experi
enced with all kinds of apartment developers.  
And the question was asked, how much increase in gr
oss rents will it take with today™s levels of 
interest rates and construction costs before it becomes economi
cal again or attractive for 
professional apartment developers to r
eenter the market in any strength.   
He said it would depend largely on various geographic areas.  For instance, he said in the 
Atlanta area, Mr. Kimbrel, that re
nts had stayed so flat so long that it would take at least a 
25 percent increase in gross rents to make it attr
active.  In the Baltimore area, where they were 
operating and where there had been some continua
l increase in gross rents, he felt 15 percent would do it.  And I find that these comments of his are pretty typical of those around the country.  I hear some comments, for instance, in California 
that it may take a 20 to 22 percent increase to 
make it economically attractive, where 
there is some prospect of profit. 
MR. PARTEE.  Is that prospective rents, or do they have it in hand before they start? MR. JACKSON.  Well, as you approach the 
margin you will find some people begin to 
anticipate, certainly.  But here again, this f
eeds back to the attitude of the institutional 
investors--the insurance companies, the banks
.  They got burned because they made some 
investments on expectations of increases that di
d not materialize, and they will remember it a 
long time, in my judgment, and they won™t fall fo
r that again.  They want to see bird in hand before they [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  To what degree do we have rent controls in our country at the present time?  Does anyone have the facts in hand? 
7/19-20/76 - 37 - 
MR. KIMBREL.  Rent controls in Atlanta, is that upon supply? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, yes, but I™m thinking of governmental controls. 
MR. KIMBREL.  No, none at all. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, they™re spread around the country, but I don™t know to what degree.  Could we have a factual reading on that? MR. GRAMLEY.  In our areas, community pr
essures of the quasi-governmental kind 
operated on rent increases.  That™s true in the Washington area--w
e™ll try to [obtain] as much qualitative information as possible. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good.  And I think we™re having an excellent economic 
discussion today.  Mr. Baughman. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, if for some
 reason we were to see a more rapid decline in the deficit than is built into the projection, would we [unintelligible] a bullish or a bearish development so far as economic expansion 
and prices go?  Mr. Pa
rtee had one side of that picture, the government expenditure 
side.  If Mr. Gramley would give us-- 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If I may just supplement that, Mr. Chairman, this is the 
same point that I was going to raise.  We have 
had a fairly sharp decline in the full-employment 
deficit, and it levels off awhile, according to 
the projection, and then you get another decline and 
a movement into the surplus. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But it™s very 
small--those figures are so tiny. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  
The figure is bigger than that for the previous-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, no, I mean the proj
ected full-employment surplus.  The-- 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No, the surplus is tiny when you get to a surplus-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I™m using the term su
rplus as a [unintelligible].  You take the 
projected figures on the full-employment surplus [
unintelligible] they are very small, and I don™t 
think the trend is 
of any significance. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  
Well, this is basically my question now, what 
significance Mr. Gramley attached to that-- 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I certainly would agree with 
the Chairman that the movement in the 
surplus is small.  The projected figure that 
we had for the second quarter--and I don™t know how much revision will be necessary because of the stat
istics that came out this morning--but we had 
a high projection of $5 billion, and we had a project
ed move to about a $4 billion surplus for the 
fourth quarter of 1977.  Now that™s not a large move.  It™s in the right direction in the period in which business activity is expanding.   7/19-20/76 - 38 - 
To turn to President Baughman™s question, I co
nfess to being a traditionalist.  That is, I believe that, at this stage of the cycle, a la
rger deficit would have 
a stimulating effect on 
economic activity.  And I believe it would have an
 adverse effect on inflationary problems, that 
is, it would tend to increase prices. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would dissent from that 
judgment.  I think if we had a significant 
increase in the deficit, it would have negative effects on the economy at the present time. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like 
to call attention also to [the fact] that 
we seem to have a very rapid growth in deposit
s and loans in country banks in our part of the country.  And the loan figures listed exclude their sales of federal funds, which are substantial.  We are hearing what I think is
 a fairly optimistic discussion 
about possibilities of beginning some part [unintelligible].  We hear smaller figures  [unintelligible] to the necessary increase in 

rents and [unintelligible] they may be about a poin
t further down.  [Unintelligible.]  It seems to 
me I hear rather conflicting stories that, in some 
of these items, rather large inventories are being 
held, possibly in a speculative situation, and ra
ther bullish expectations [unintelligible]. 
One of our directors reported that the [increase] in the mi
nimum wage has raised labor 
costs 90 percent in their stores. 
 Now I heard a number of store 
managements recently indicate 
that they have initiated rather intensive programs, frequently invol
ving the engagement of 
outside firms, to come in to help them to hol
d down the longer [unintelligible] and increase the 
output for worker [unintelligible] hours.  I™m 
not sure that™s [unintelligible] anything, Mr. 
Chairman, but I just [unintelligib
le] indication of what™s going on. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Mr. Volcker, do you have any comment? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Balles, please. 

MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I would like 
to ask Lyle a few questions about the monetary assumptions underlying the Board™s staff 
forecast.  In comparing our own forecast with 
yours, Lyle, I find they™re fairly similar up to mi
d-™77, but you begin to get some difference in 
the second half of ™77.  Our forecast is coming in 
considerably lower in terms of real growth, for 
example, than yours.  In the structure of the 
GNP accounts, it tends to show up principally in 
things like personal consumption 
and inventories, but I think possibly one of the explanations may be on the monetary assumption.  Just as a po
int of fact, am I correct in thinking that you were assuming a 5-3/4 percent growth path for M1? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s correct.  And continui
ng that path beyond the second quarter of next year. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I want to commen
t on this point. That™s the mechanical 
model, but then you introduce a judgmental f
actor, and at the end you don™t know what the monetary assumption is. 
7/19-20/76 - 39 - 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I would acknowledge that co
mment also, Mr. Chairman.  And I would 
say that one of the chief problems we have had in
 developing our judgmental forecast is that we  have not been able to come to grips with the ki
nds of financial restraints that past experience 
suggests should be developing with the growth rate of M1 at 5-3/4 percent.  Now we have to make some judgment as to how much furt
her downward movement in the money demand 
function will occur.  And we take that number ri
ght off the wall; it™s that subjective.  And I think 
forecasters looking as far ahead as late 1977 can 
come to markedly different conclusions about 
the economic [environment] that will emerge from
 maintaining a 5-3/4 percent growth rate in 
M1. MR. PARTEE.  I [unintelligible] on that velocity. MR. GRAMLEY.  Pardon me? 

MR. PARTEE.  Your rising velocity continues right through ™77. MR. GRAMLEY.  Yeah, right, that is
, the rate of increase in velocity tapers off just a trifle 
because towards the latter pa
rt of the period both the rate of pr
ice increase and the rate of real 
GNP growth are just a trifle less, but basically 
it™s a very large and continuing increase in income 
velocity of M1 in the projections. MR. BALLES.  Well, this gets to the princi
pal point I was going to make.  In our own 
forecast, by the end of ™77, the increase in M1 ve
locity will be just a touch above its long-term 
trend rate of 3 percent; for M2, it™s just a touch 
above its long-term trend rate of close to zero.  
And I gather your velocities are somewhat higher than that. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, they are. 

MR. BALLES.  Now, to be very frank about it
, I think I would have to concur with the Chairman™s observation at the last
 meeting, which was, if I recall correctly, Mr. Chairman, that 
we cannot expect the large increases in velocity to continue, and I come out with about that same 
conclusion. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  So does Lyle. MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, indeed.  You see over the 
last year the rest of the increase in 
income velocity on the order of 92 to 80 percent, 
but it™s not just a question of the extent to 
which the income velocity of money goes [unintelligible] like that.  What sort of financial 

restraints have developed?  What does this mean
 for the future?  And I think that what you are 
suggesting is that the kind of pressure on interest rates that we™re forecasting is much too 
moderate--[you would] expect a mu
ch larger rise in interest rates, much more tightness to 
develop in financial markets, a weaker pattern 
to housing, and so on.  And that™s a possibility.  But you see, that™s the sort of thing we™ve b
een forecasting repeatedly since the middle of 1975, 
and we™ve been wrong. MR. BALLES.   Well, I think, to put this in
 prospective, I have to say my faith in 
anybody™s forecast, including our own, [decreases] 
in geometrical proportion to every quarter 
7/19-20/76 - 40 - 
added to the forecast horizon, so I can™t really sa
y that we have irreconcilable differences by the 
time it gets to the fourth quarter of ™77. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, can
 I ask a small question here? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, please. 

MR. EASTBURN.   Lyle, would you say that, on velocity, your forecasts are in line with 
forecasts that other people are making? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  It's hard to say because the ot
her forecasts of GNP that we have rarely explicitly forecast M1.  
There are three forecasts that I've l
ooked at for which we have statistics 
all the way in terms of both M1 and real GNP. 
 In general, the other two besides ours had a slower increase in velocity than we did and somewhat higher increases in M1 than we had 
projected. MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, may I ask to 
what extent is the impact of velocity 
projections being influenced by the changes in the character of the 
definition of money ? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, th
at's a significant factor. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, we are maintaining our tr
aditional definition of M1 [unintelligible] demand deposits.  We are aware of the fact 
that a variety of changes are going on in the economic system which are leading to economiza
tion of money balances so defined.  We are 
also aware, however, that merely redefining the 
stock of money to include the time and savings 
deposits at commercial banks ot
her than large denomination CD
s does not solve the problem.  
There is economization of that 
concept of money going on, also, and what we are projecting in 
terms of an increase in the income velocity of 
M2 is also high in terms of experience.  We're 
projecting a rise of somewhere ar
ound a 2-3/4 to 3 percent annual rate over the next six quarters, whereas the trend rate of increase, as President 
Balles has suggested, would be close to zero.  We 
know no way to merely redefine money to get ar
ound this problem.  Presumably there is a way, 
if we only knew what it was, but we don't have the answer. 
MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, one of the 
hypotheses about the above-average rise in velocity in the first year of the expansion was that it was a normal feature 
of the early expansion.  Now, to the extent that that was the explanati
on of what we observed, one would have to assume 
that in the latter stages of the expansion, velocity ought to expand below average, other things not taken into account here. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Be careful.  When you talk about ﬁaverage,ﬂ the average may be a 
long-run trend average or an average for the expa
nsion phase of a business cycle or an average for successive phases of the expansion. MR. WALLICH.  That™s what I had in mind. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, historically, the latter [meanings feat
ure a] progressive diminution on the average.  But there is second 
fact to it, and that is changing financial 
technology, which has been extraordinarily rapid.  Therefore, [business] cycle experience is one 7/19-20/76 - 41 - 
guide, and then [there are] these changes in financial technology partly induced by our own regulations.  It™s very hard to judge the future--and I didn™t know the staff projection of 5 percent; I just heard it today for the first time--but if I had been asked to make a judgment, it 
would have been in that area--above [the] average cyclical experience and certainly above [the] average secular experience. 
MR. WALLICH.  That puts a heavier burden 
on the technological [source of] demand 
changes because, looking purely at the cyclical pattern, there™s a case for some secular slowing 
in the rise of velocity. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, Lyle has moved from
 8 percent to 5 percent.  The question is should he have moved further. 
 But you know, after you do all that, there™s still a judgment, and 
that™s partly mechanical analyses
 as to where these are going.   All right, before we break for coffee, would anyone else want to comment on the 
economy?  If not, I take it this part of our discussi
on is at an end, and individuals may feel free to 
return to the subject as they see fit. 
[Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we are ready 
to resume our meeting and return to our 
discussion of the monetary aggregates over th
e coming year.  I would like to make a few 
observations on that subject by way of introducing our discussion.   I think we always have to remind ourselves that
 our objective is not to achieve this or that rate of monetary growth that we project.  Our 
objective is to do what we can in the monetary 
sphere to further our basic economic objective--t
hat is the growth of our economy, a reduction of 
unemployment, and reductions as well in the rate 
of inflation.  Nevertheless, it™s useful to look back and see to what degree our projections have been borne out.   Between the second quarter of 1975 and the second quarter of 1976, the rate of growth of M1 was 5.2 percent, just a shade above the lower limit of M1 as we projected it a year ago.  The rate of growth of M2 was 9.8 percent, a little ab
ove the midpoint of M2 as we projected it a year 
ago.  The rate of growth of M3 was 12.1 percent, or just about at the upper limit of our projection 
of M3 a year ago.  So if others want to judge us by our projections, we™ve once again done quite well.  But I want to repeat that that™s not the way in which we want to judge ourselves.   We are all keenly aware of the very sharp rate of growth of M1 during the second quarter.  The rate of growth, I believe, was 8.4 percent.  Even so, the rate of growth for the year, including that quarter, was merely 5.2 percent.
  In other words, we had a sizable overshoot in that quarter, and we had undershoots in earlier quarters.  So let™s keep that fact in mind as our discussion 
proceeds.   
Now there are certain principles that we have been observing and that I think we should continue to observe in setting longer-range targets.  One is simplicity in formulation.  We don™t 
want to inform the public of some complicated
 scheme of monetary 
calculation or monetary 
projection.  We want to state something that 
is simple and can be readily understood.  We™ve 
done that hitherto, and I think we must continue to do that.   
7/19-20/76 - 42 - 
Second, and I don™t think one could overem
phasize the importance of it, we must 
absolutely avoid any appearance of shifting our procedures.  We have been making projections 
for a 12-month period, as the current [congression
al] resolution requires.  We™ve been doing it on 
the basis of a quarterly base.  Now there ought to be a decisive reason for a change, and if there is a decisive reason for a change it ought to apply not only to what we do today but to some 
indefinite future.  We don™t want to be char
ged with manipulating our figures.  We can be 
charged with stupidity; I can take that.  We can 
be charged with incompetence; I can take that.  
But we must not be charged with a lack of integr
ity or with manipulation.  
The greatest asset that 
we have is our integrity, and we™ve got to keep that in mind in what we do.   
Now today, as always, the arguments are for 
moving in one directi
on or another with respect to our growth rates, but I think that our discussion today is likely to revolve around the question, Do we leave the ranges unchanged or do we lower them?  I doubt if there will be much 

sentiment in the Committee to raise them, and I will proceed on that assumption.   
Let me turn primarily to M1, though I™ll also 
have some observations to make about M2 
and M3.  I think there are some cogent arguments for 
lowering the range at this time.  First of all, 
the prospect for continued expansion of the economy is good, and an additional small step 
toward a growth range that is more nearly in 
keeping with reasonable price stability could very well be defended.  The second argument for lo
wering the range might be that we had an 
overshoot in the second quarter and that we may need to offset that overshoot.   
There are arguments also for leaving the [g
rowth] range [for M1] unchanged.  We™ve had a 
very good economic discussion today.  Some diverg
ence of views were expressed.  I happen to be more optimistic than the staff.  Nevertheless, 
I think it™s only fair to recognize that the real economy has recently shown some signs of hesita
tion.  Consumer spending rose considerably 
less in the second quarter than in the first.  The growth in industrial production has tapered off, and residential construction has been weaker than many of us had expecte
d.  Now I believe that these uncertainties are likely to be resolved on th
e side of renewed, rather vigorous expansion in the late summer and fall.  Business capita
l spending should be gathering strength.   The general public would not understand a move to
ward a restriction at the present time.  
But once evidence of renewed vigorous expansion appears three months late
r, I think the public would interpret [that as the] more
 appropriate time to move towa
rd a firmer monetary policy.   
[The public] would understand that we are doing better.  That is one reason for not rocking the boat at the present time and for leaving 
the growth range for M1 unchanged.   Now a second reason is that velocity [growth], or the rate of growth of the turnover of money, has definitely moderated, and we cannot reasonably expect anything like the rapid increase of velocity that occurred last year to continue.  That is a second reason for not lowering the growth range for M1, for leaving it unchanged.   The third reason is that, [although] the overshoot [in the growth of M1] that occurred in the 
second quarter was disturbing to us at the time
 and even in retrospect, it merely brought the 
longer-run growth since early 1975 to a pace that
 is entirely consistent with the current 
Committee range, and actually close to the lower limits.   
7/19-20/76 - 43 - 
And finally, if some of us, or
 the Committee as a whole, would wish to make up for the 
rapid growth of M1 in the second quarter, there is really no need to signal the move toward 
restriction.  We have a pretty wide range.  We
 can do that as we move along from month to 
month by aiming toward somewhat the lower part of
 the range.  So as I think about the problem, 
and I have pondered this over recent weeks as I know the rest of you have, I reach the conclusion that there is really no clear 
reason to alter the range for 
M1 at the present time.   
Now, I feel a little differently about M2 and M3.  
MR. ROOS.  Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, did 
you mean based on the quarterly adjustment 
of the base or on the original-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All that I™m saying is, 
we had a range from the first quarter of 
1976 to the first quarter of 1977 of 4-1/2 to 7 perc
ent.  I™m saying that the range from the second 
quarter of 1976 to the second quarter of ™77 should continue to be 4-1/2 to 7 percent.  That is my 
suggestion to the Committee.   
As I say, I feel a little differently about M2 and M3.  We had a considerable slowing in the 
inflow of savings during June.  Now the inflow in the early days of July was much improved.  I 
think most of us expect interest rates to rise 
later on in the year, although we™ll differ as to the degree of rise.  Therefore a lower rate of growth of M3 and of M2 is only to be expected. I™d be inclined to reduce the upper limit of M3 by 1 percen
tage point, that is have the range run from 9 to 11 instead of 9 to 12.  And I™d be in
clined to reduce the upper limit of M2 by half a 
percentage point and have it run from 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 instead of 7-1/2 to 10.  But I [propose those changes] not really for the reason that I indicated--[which was] ma
inly expectations with regard to interest rate behavior and savings inflows.  I would like to do it for another reason.  By this slight move we would continue to move gra
dually toward somewhat lower monetary growth 
rates that are more consistent with general pr
ice stability.  And I thi
nk we can do that quite safely, quite reasonably, and the general stance of our policy both in the short run and over the longer run I think would be well served by such moves.   That™s my advice to the Committee.  We are lik
ely to have more than one opinion at this 
table on a question that is so complicated.  There™
ll be arguments in all 
directions.  Let™s hear from members of the Committ
ee.  Mr. Morris, please. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I like your set of 
prescriptions.  I™d like to go back to a comment I wanted to make earlier on the usefulness of these alternative monetary policy formulations.  Seems to me that they don™t have 
an awful lot of relevance to us because of the 
time horizon of the projections.  That is, when
ever you ask an economic model to give you the 
economic effects of the more e
xpansionary policy over a fairly short period of time, you™re up 
against the fact that the lags
 in the impact of monetary po
licy are much shorter on production 
than they are on prices.   
I think every sheet of this kind that I have seen in the past eight years around this table suggested that a more expansionary policy woul
d produce benefits in greater real growth and very little in price effects, and I think that re
flects the fact that the tim
e horizon for this kind of exercise has got to be longer to be useful to the Committee.   7/19-20/76 - 44 - 
It seems to me that for this kind of analysis to
 really give us much insight, we need to push it out to 1978 or 1979.  Now I know that the further out you get, the more difficult time you have 
in projecting.  Nonetheless, b
ecause of the differential lags of
 monetary policy between output 
and prices, I don™t think that this kind of analysis is really very helpful.  The other question I had-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me just make a comm
ent.  To do what we can in the way of longer-run objectives is salutary.  And that™s not inconsistent with anything that we have to do today and in later meetings.  But we have to 
do something very specific today, mainly to set 
monetary growth ranges for the next 12 months 
for the interval between the second quarter of this year and the second quarter of next year. MR. MORRIS.  I think that™s right, sir, but I don™t think we can set them solely on the 
basis of the projections of the next 12 to 18 months.  I think imp
licitly we are not acting on that, and if we were, we would have to revise our monetary growth upward. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it™s a matter of 
judgment, you see.  I think that over the 
longer run, over the next few years, we should get our monetary growth ranges down to a level 
where they are consistent with general price stabilit
y.  That was the last point that I made.  That™s 
why, even though I would like to stay with M1 where it is as of today, I did want to make a 
further move on M2 and M3 to continue what
 we™ve been doing in recent meetings--moving 
slowly, taking small steps.  But taking small step
s that are prudent and that inch [forward] over several years give us a chance to get back to
 something close to general price stability. 
MR. MORRIS.  The other question I had, Mr. Chairman, was more of a technical nature.  
Looking at the alternative B projections for the credit proxy, I see that we are projecting a slower rate of growth for the proxy than was the case three months ago.  This seems a little curious to 

me.  I don™t know whether we are presenting th
e proxy to the [congressional] committee or not, 
but if we are-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have stopped doing that. MR. MORRIS.  I see.  It™s hard for me to 
understand why, if M1 is going to grow at the same rate, why the proxy would grow at a slower 
rate over the next 12 months than our estimate 
made three months ago. 
MR. KICHLINE.  We have consistently b
een underestimating the growth of the proxy. 
Historical experience accounts for part of the adjustment
, the second part relates-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  They were
 underestimated--excuse me? 
MR. KICHLINE.  --to the fact that we--the targets have been higher. CHAIRMAN BURNS   Oh yes, yes, very much higher. 

MR. KICHLINE.  --than the actual experience.  Secondly, 
business loan expansion has been relatively modest in our projections thr
oughout, but this time I thi
nk we also had a small 
marginal downward adjustment in our expectati
ons for business loans and hence a little bit less 7/19-20/76 - 45 - 
expansion in CDs that are forecast.  That also 
would contribute to our expectation of slower 
growth in the proxy. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™re a good student, Mr. Morris.  I really paid no attention to 
the credit proxy in thinking of our long-range ta
rget because I don™t understand it.  I™m glad you 
asked the question because I ought to understand it. 
MR. PARTEE.  If M2 were a little less [unintelligible], it w
ould account for a bit less of the proxy. MR. MORRIS.  Yes, but I assume that it
™s mostly CD policy that™s dominant. 
MR. KICHLINE.  That™s correct. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All ri
ght, Mr. Balles please. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I find myself
 in substantial agreement with your 
conclusions, mostly for the same reasons.  I would lik
e to refer to a set of 
charts I have taken the liberty of distributing here to make two quick points.   
I think you put into focus very well the fact that over the past year, taken as a whole, our growth rates of the various Ms have been either within or very close to the top of the range we set ourselves.  I think that the fact that we shift bases every quarter makes us look worse in 
practice than we really are.  That is to say, it doesn™t bring out the point that you made so well, 
that we had been within our ranges over a period of a year.   That point is brought out on the second page of this set of charts, which shows [unintelligible] that we set, and growth ranges that we set going 
clear back to the beginning of this whole exercise.  There are a lot of lines th
at tend to be somewhat 
confusing on this set of charts, but the net of all of this is that, preceding the overshoot that occurred in the second quarter of 1976, we had two undershoots--we were well under the ranges for both the first quarter of 1976 and the fourth quarter of 1975.  That is one reason that I™m in favor of your final recommendations as to the growth ranges.  But I 
view the second quarter as being something of a 
catch-up from the undershoots of the first quarter of the year and the last quarter of 1975.   More to the point, this chart shows that we missed the range altogeth
er-- we™re above it in the second quarter and below it in the preceding two qua
rters.  To the extent that we have a sort 
of public understanding problem he
re, I think we would be better served sometime, certainly not 
now in my opinion, to perhaps cons
ider shifting to a fixed base of, say, the fourth quarter of the year for the following calendar year.   I don™t think this is the time to do it, and I 
am not recommending that it we do it now.  But 
if we had gone that route in the past--say, if we had set for ourselves the fourth quarter of 1975 as a base--[growth through] the second quarter of 1976 would cover a six-month period and 
show a 5.6 percent increase in M1, close to the middle of the range, and an 11.1 percent increase 
of M2, which is just a touch above the upper end of the M2 range.   7/19-20/76 - 46 - 
So, in terms of one of your guiding principles
 of simplicity, it might 
actually be easier for the public and Congress, academics, to understand if
 we had a fixed base rather than a shifting 
base.   The other point I wanted to make just quick
ly while I have the floor and you have the charts in front of you [relates to the] first page of the set of charts labeled M1.  This is my continuing concern, that the market is reacting pe
rversely, sometimes irrationally, to our weekly 
published figures of the seasonally adjusted data.  One can find all sorts of illustrations of this.  

In this morning™s 
Wall Street Journal, for example, there is a story about the wholesale dumping 
of bond inventories yesterday by dealers, at cut-rate prices, and the stock market was down 
sharply, and all apparently because of interest rate
 fears.  It doesn™t take much [to stoke such 
fears,] because the latest weekly figur
es of money show quite a jump.   
To the extent that we can solve that problem, 
I think we ought to try.  And I™m back to my 
favorite theme here, hoping not to be
 a nag, but I think this is an important point.  We need--in 
my opinion--some sort of filtering device to put 
these weekly seasonally adjusted money supply 
figures in some better perspective, and the onl
y way I know how to do that is to smooth them 
through a moving average device [unintelligible],
 what happened quite recently on the funds rate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, just a question, are you referring to the figures that we publish or are you referring to thinking by this Committee? 
MR. BALLES.  I™m referring to the 
figures we publish, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You would publish the moving averages. MR. BALLES.  I would publish the moving average to try to get away from what 
happened yesterday, where the market reacted, in
 my opinion, in the wrong way to a single week™s worth of figures.  We™ve seen this repe
ated again and again and again.  And I am hoping that someday I can convince my colleagues around 
the table here to make some sort of device 
that we can publish ourselves so that the market
 would understand that there are a lot of random 
fluctuations in these weekly figures and, indeed, even in the monthly figures.  We need a longer-
term measure of where we stand in terms of levels of the aggregates. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well now, if your sugges
tion is that in putting out our weekly 
reports on the money supply we add a co
lumn that would show a 13-week moving 
average--without committing myself to that pr
ecise period--you are not going to have any difficulty convincing me.  I 
think it would be a good idea. MR. BALLES.  I™m glad to hear that, that™s 
exactly the sort of thing I am recommending.  
Not committing myself to 13 weeks as the optimum
 period, but that™s pretty close to what the 
tests of statistical significance would show to be the number of weeks you have to have to 
dampen random fluctuations to a point where th
ey account for less than half of the observed week-to-week movements. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS   Yeah, Mr. Broida calls to my attention that your table has 
projections.  I was referring simply to the week
ly figures.  When we publish the latest weekly 7/19-20/76 - 47 - 
number, we also show, you see, the moving averag
e, and I think that would be helpful, I think our staff ought to go to work on that and come
 forward with a recommendation one way or 
another.  I think it is a good idea. 
MR. PARTEE.  I recommend that we do it, Mr. Chairman. 

MR. JACKSON.  We publish a four-week 
and a 13-week moving average, don™t we? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Do we not? 

MR. GRAMLEY.  We have 
a four-week average. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Do we publish a 13-week or longer than three-month average? MR. GRAMLEY.  Not to the best of my knowledge. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that a longer-- MR. GRAMLEY.  I would remind you, Mr. Chairman, that if you publish a 13-week 
centered moving average, the centering of that pe
riod will be 6-1/2 weeks prior to the current date, and I would be willing to bet my bottom dollar that market reaction to that would be one 
huge yawn. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now wait, now wait, th
e table that I visual
ize would show the figure for the latest week and on the same line, an
 average covering, let us say, that week and the 12 preceding weeks, which means that the centering w
ould be at the end of the period rather than 
at the middle of the period. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  The centering in terms of 
the location on the page, but anybody familiar 
with statistics would know that that™s a 13-week moving average.  The center of that is 6-1/2 weeks ago. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you can interpret it that way, and I know all about that, but the simple interpretation would be that this is
 an average for this week and the preceding 12 
weeks.  You have a longer-term average.  You 
have now a four-week average--all right, a 13-week average; now there is some uncertainty 
here as to what we actually publish, and it™s embarrassing to me not to know what we actually
 publish.  Mr. Jackson indicates that we were already doing it. MR. JACKSON.  I am not sure of the 13 weeks,
 but I believe I™ve seen in the last two, 
three days our most recent publication on the four-week. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Does someb
ody know what we actually publish? MR. STERNLIGHT.  Mr. Chairman, I believe we 
give the latest weekly figure, the last four-week average, and then a comparison of th
at last four-week [period] with a four-week period three months earlier. 7/19-20/76 - 48 - 
MR. PARTEE.  Yeah, it™s not exactly a 13-week period. MR. STERNLIGHT.  No, but I think you have a rather similar concept. MR. PARTEE.  We introduced it for this very reason several years ago.  The same 
discussion occurred virtually-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I th
ink that my impression is that the newspaper™s pretty 
faithful in reporting it this way, too, but I think you are up against the fact that the only news is the latest week™s figure, and that is what they
 look at on the ticker on Thursday afternoon or whenever it comes out, unless it™s in the headlines. 
MR. BALLES.  Paul, that™s exactly why I™d like 
to have us educate the market to not place 
so much weight on what the very 
latest weekly figures show.  I think they react irrationally to 
that.  We™re getting observations th
at are unjustified and disturbing. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would say the market r
eacts irrationally.  I would also say that I 
think there is some tendency on the part of th
is Committee--and because of this Committee, at 
the Desk--also to react irrationally to these fi
gures.  I think we are in danger of becoming 
excessively mechanical monetarists. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, Mr. Chai
rman, I think the problem is with the manner in which we 
pursue the aggregates.  It™s very difficult not to take into account recent data.  In fact the whole idea of optimal control is to take full account 
of recent information, and if one doesn™t do that, 
one finds that, a few weeks or months down the roa
d, one is very far off target.  But what we are doing now is to pursue the aggregates by means of 
the federal funds rate, and that attributes a great deal of importance to the 
rates, so that the whole struct
ure of other rates have become 
hinged to it as if it were the discount rate in the United Kingdom.   
Everything moves; that constrains our ability to 
move that [unintelligible].  If we could get 
by with operating in a way that isn™t based on the funds rate, the funds rate would be simply a 
residual result, then the market wouldn™t attribute that much importance to it; bill rates and other 

rates wouldn™t be so tightly hinged to it; and we™d
 have more freedom to let the funds rate move 
about.  That was the idea essentially of having a wider funds rate [range]--2 percent instead of what we™ve been having recently, 1/2 of 1 per
cent--and we™ve been moving away from that 
objective rather than toward it. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Are you suggesting, Henry, that 
we have a zone of indifference in the federal funds rate as we do in monetary aggregates? 
MR. WALLICH.  In one way or another, I 
think we ought to get away from the narrow range.  Operating on nonborrowed reserves doesn™t seem to co
mmend itself in terms of the 
experience that is described in the Bluebook and in the New York report--maybe operating more 

directly on the aggregates themselves without
 using the funds rate would do the trick. MR. JACKSON.  The consequence of that, Mr. Chairman, as I understand that suggestion, 
would be to react more irrationally, because you
™d have a wider range over which reaction would 
take place over the same uncertain information. 
7/19-20/76 - 49 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there are complex 
questions here.  I do think that, during the past year at least, we may have
 been overreacting in adjusting the federal funds rate to temporary 
changes in monetary growth rates, and a little greater stability in the federal funds rate is an alternative, really, to what you™re saying, Henry.  But I think these are questions that we ought to continue discussing and debating.  Perhaps we o
ught to set aside a full meeting for a discussion 
of this very question, and have good staff preparation for such a seminar. 
MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman I would like to ta
ke just one more minute to make a point, 
and then I™ll be quiet.  On page 1 of these char
ts, I would not for public purposes have the Board [staff]™s own forecast with the five or six weeks ah
ead.  I think it would be a very useful thing for 
this Committee to see, and I think it raises
 a point that is worth a little thought.   In June, the decline in the M1
 growth rate occurred within the context of an overshoot in the second quarter as a whole.  The Board staff™s forecast of the weeks ahead on this page as 

shown in the [unintelligible], beginning July 7 and August 4 it shows a very sharp recovery will be occurring.  And in that context I raise the question as to whet
her the recent reduction in the federal funds rate, apparently in response to th
e [unintelligible] June figures is really the 
appropriate response if one were to view the best measure of the le
vel of M1 as the smooth series of a 13-week moving average.   
Because once one incorporates the weekly foreca
sts, we have a forecast line here of what 
the moving average itself would look like based on 
that forecast of weekly data, and the moving 
average of the forecast of this also shows [uni
ntelligible] upper end of the range.  In short, I 
would also raise the question as to what our response ought to be when the single month™s 
figures come in on the low side without having the full context of this smoothing or moving 
average device.  That™s not something we need to 
settle today, but I would like to just lay that 
thought on the table for future consideration when we have this kind of meeting that you 

suggested. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I hope you keep on repeating that suggestion, and I do think we 
ought to plan for a seminar in the not too dist
ant future on this question.  Mr. Partee, did you have a comment? 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, I was just going to make
 one small comment on that, and that is, 
isn™t the question of what we have done in the last four weeks a question of what this looks like compared to what we thought it would look like 
four weeks ago?  And I think you™ll find it™s 
lower; that is, the June-July average is significantly lower than we
 anticipated at the time of the 
last meeting.  Now your line here for the rec
overy, if you believe it, is a consideration for 
[judging] current policy this time.  But not for 
judging current policy over the last four weeks, I don™t think. MR. BALLES.  I agree. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. Guffey now, please. MR. GUFFEY.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I think 
I agree totally with the recommendation 
already made but I would like to focus on that pa
rt of the recommendation that suggests that you 
leave the range of M1 [growth] as 
it has been in the past, and I believe that™s 4-1/2 [to 7] percent.  7/19-20/76 - 50 - 
I subscribe to the proposition you set out, that we s
hould be taking a cut each time at the inflation 
problem.  And further, I understand you to say that 
these ranges would give us the latitude to do that, and I subscribe to that.   But now to move to my point, it seems to me 
that, if the staff™s projection is correct and 
things are moving a little more ra
pidly three months from now as we move on into the fall, it is 
going to be a little more difficult to move that u
pper range down.  And as a result of the pause we 
find ourselves in, and to affirm 
the position that has been stated publicly that inflation is our greatest problem, I would like to see us move
 the upper [bound] of M1 down 1/2 percentage point this time, which will bring us down to 6-1/
2.  I understand that it doesn™t mean a great deal, 
but for public view I would like to see us do it now.  I think it™s easier to do it now than it would be three months from now. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. MacLaury now, please. MR. MACLAURY.  I find myself very much in 
sympathy with what Roger has just said.  
First of all, I start out with you, Mr. Chairman.  
I can™t tell you really why I think the economic 
outlook is going to be stronger than the Greenbook forecast.  Chuck has given us a couple of potential reasons, but it™s my guess 
that it will turn out to be stronger.  And furthermore, I think 
we have been happily surprised, at least in the wage rate area, that
 we have not seen the kinds of increases that we might have expe
cted, and we can argue there that the prospect for inflation is better; at least we have a better basis for our expectations than we had before.   I point out that the way we have been m
oving the M1 range down 1/2 point on one end, and the next [on the other] end, if my arithmetic is correct, gives 
us 1 percentage point per year.  If we were to do that continuously over time, we
ll, if we™re 4-1/2 to 7 now in ™76, we™d be at 2-1/2 to 5 in ™78, and so on.  It would take us a very long time, even if we continuously followed 
this pattern that we have.  We could accelerate th
at at some point if it seemed necessary.   
The last point, I guess, is that it will be mo
re difficult in Octobe
r-November of election 
time to make a further adjustment downward in th
e M1 range than it is to do so today.  And I think, therefore, for these various reasons, I woul
d opt for a 1/2 point reduction in the upper end of the range today.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me make one observation 
in timing.  I can™t be at all sure as to 
the date of the fall hearings under the concurrent resolution, but it would come normally either at 
the end of October or early in November, and I would certainly do everything possible to have 
that meeting come after the electi
on rather than a few days before. MR. MACLAURY.  That would ease to some extent
 that dilemma, as I see it, if that could 
be worked out.  I think I would still stick with the suggestion, but I don™t feel all that strongly about it.   A couple of points on John Balles™s comments.  I have felt, as I said before, that the moving base is a bit of a problem.  Rather than ta
king a fixed basis, as John suggests, I™ve always been more sympathetic to the idea of starting ou
r targets in terms of dollar levels, which do not 
move when the basis moves out a year.   
7/19-20/76 - 51 - 
And secondly, the market overreaction.  I thi
nk Henry™s put his finger on it exactly.  It 
doesn™t matter so much what kind of average we
 publish.  I agree with Lyle that as a longer average it™ll be largely ignored.  But [it is] rather our method 
of operation, and so long as we pay as much attention to the funds 
rate as our [unintelligible] and hold it in its narrow range as we have been doing, the market will be very unders
tandably but incorrectly looking to this linkage that we have ourselves created.  I think the only way we can prevent overre
action to moves in the 
funds rate is to be less circumscribed in those 
movements ourselves.  I ju
st want to reinforce what Henry said. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Wallich now, please. 

MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, I find your list of
 pros and cons very complete, and I find the cons more persuasive, that is, cons agains
t reducing the M1 range now.  I would supplement 
that by saying I think 5 percent real growth is not very much.  I think there™s room for more.  As 
I view the expansion, there probably will be more, and I wouldn™t want to do anything at this 

time to reduce the prospect of that.  
Now so much with respect to M1.   
With respect to M2 and M3, one point that 
gives me a problem with your suggestion is 
that, after all, we aren™t operating on expecta
tions of what these variables will be, which may 
well be influenced by outflows from the thrifts. 
 But these are supposed to be our instruments 
which we set, and if there are outflows from the th
rifts, that seems to impl
y that we ought to take some action to keep the growth ra
te of those aggregates nevertheless at the level that we thought appropriate.  The staff seems to think that, for 
alternative B, a gap of 3 percentage points between the growth of M1 and the growth of M2 is the expected relationship, and I would be 
reluctant to alter that. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me just say a word a
bout that.  I want to be corrected if I™m wrong, but my understanding is that the staff struggled hard with that question and finally came 
up with the conclusion that probably [making] no 
change would be more consistent with leaving 
growth rates for M1 unchanged; but this was a very delicate decision for the staff.  Is that correct, 
Mr. Kichline? 
MR. KICHLINE.  Are you talking about M1 or M2? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Talking about M2. 

MR. KICHLINE.  That™s right.  Our best judgment provided a forecast for M2 that is just 
marginally below the current range, and we felt 
that under those circumstances the staff would 
not specify a change, but the tendency was for our
 forecasters to provide somewhat lower deposit 
flows rather than higher. MR. WALLICH.  Well, that weakens my 
case somewhat.  However, I would apply 
reasoning to M3 that is similar to what you have 
applied, Mr. Chairman.  I have no great faith in 
M3 as an instrument.  I wouldn™t attach as much 
weight to it as a symbol 
of the tendency to bring growth rates down--and I think that™s a valuable symbolism--as I would to M1 and M2.  I would 
be quite prepared to make a small downward adjustment in the upper [end] of M3. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.
  Mr. Black, may we hear from you? 
7/19-20/76 - 52 - 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I end up ex
actly where you do on M1, and I carefully compared these ﬁmoving megaphonesﬂ and found that 
there is sufficient overlap, so that if I move my own thoughts down to a lower rate of
 growth, they could be accommodated by the existing specifications.   I do get bothered by these changing bases, and I think what John Balles said has a good deal of merit to it.  I personally
 prefer the sort of approach that Bill [Hooves] suggested in the memorandum that Frank Morris provided us, wh
ere we [would] express the growth from a midpoint.  I think that would be less misleading to
 the public.  That™s something we want to get 
into in that longer session.   So far as M2 and M3 are concerned, I value 
your suggestion because I think it is desirable 
if we work these down over time.  I am a little skep
tical about interest rates rising as much as the 
staff projects.  However, I think it™s at least possible that we might ove
rshoot those, but I would still accept what you™ve got there.  In their assumptions, the staff has provided for an increase in Regulation Q [rate ceilings], and if the rates do rise as much as they think, and Regulation Q 
[ceilings are] raised, this increases the chance that you™d get more growth in M2 and M3.  I™m a 
little skeptical there, but I think the prope
r thing to do is to lower them even so. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Volcker now, please. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr
. Chairman, as often is the case, we have somewhat 
mixed signals before us in a number of respects.
  In terms of a busin
ess outlook, I find myself wishing to believe the staff forecast of prices
, and maybe that we can do it, but I am a bit 
skeptical of whether the outlook is that good.  And on the other hand, I share some of Mr. 
Eastburn™s skepticism about the plant and equipment 
side of things.  And hearing so much talk along those lines from businessme
n, I don™t have great fears that the business situation is going to run away with us on the up side.   In the light of all that--and in very general terms I™m not very eager to make changes 
now--but if I convert that into a short-run interest rate kind of feeling, I wouldn™t want to make 
any aggressive changes in the federal funds rate.  But you were talking about long-term targets on monetary aggregates, and the problem here is 
the one that you mentioned.  We start with this 
high base, and I™m left a little bit 
with the feeling that if we don™t change M1, we have in fact eased.  I™m not terribly happy about 
that prospect, and I think it™s of some significance.  I realize 
that, if you go back over a longer period, you can say we have not [eased] because we undershot in the previous two quarters.  The only difference is, I was happy about the undershooting and I™m not so happy about the overshooting, so I do 
think this is a bit of a problem.   
My own reconciliation of this is that we ought to lower the M1 ranges a shade on the presumption that this could be explained as not 
a significant change in policy or any change in policy at all from what we arrived at last time 
because we do start from a higher base.  I do share 
the third point that I think you made, that you don™t want to gi
ve any real signal of a change in policy, and if I thought this was going to be interpreted as a real tightening, I wouldn™t be very happy about it.   7/19-20/76 - 53 - 
So I guess what I would still like to do is get some shading in the M1 figure in the context 
of your April explanation that this is no real change and that we are adjusting for the overshoot.  To some extent that would be only a partial adjust
ment in the first quarter.  I™m consistent with 
not wanting to make a very great change in M2 
and M3; I will be content with their ranges as they are because I think the majo
r problem here is in M1.   
Now you™ve kind of reversed that in the context of the long-range objective, in which [you express a concern] I certainly shar
e, that we™ve got to get these th
ings down.  I™m left not feeling 
very strongly about which way we do it but I do feel we ought to get something down. I guess 
my preference would still be M1 on the presump
tion that you could explain this quite reasonably in terms of the change in the 
base, and if you think you can™t do that, I am somewhat affected in 
my own judgment. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I must give you 
a thoroughly candid response.  I think I can explain it to your satisfaction and even to my own.  But I do not
 think I can explain it to the satisfaction of the general public, including the Congress and the international community. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, this is, I think, a 
relevant question, and I think it bears upon my own judgment here, but I think in 
general terms that™s where I come out.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Mr. Eastburn, may we hear from you? 
MR. EASTBURN.  I would like to subscribe 
to the views that Governor Wallich has 
expressed, and essentially I agree with the specifications under alternative B. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Partee, may we hear from you? 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, I just wanted to say I 
have two things.  I accept the change in the 
base.  I think we do this with judgment and it™s
 not that we don™t know what™s gone before, it™s simply that we don™t have an ar
ithmetic practice that averages out.  I average the first and second quarters, and M1 growth was 5-1/2 percent exactly--a little below the midpoint.  I averaged the 
period for the whole recovery, of the first quarter of ™75 to date, and I got 5.7.   I must say, Paul, I disagree with you.  I can™t
 understand saying now that we are going to 
lower the range because of the 
second-quarter overshoot when we didn™t do any similar thing 
when we had a large first-quarter undershoot.  I might also say th
at the character of the second quarter was not the kind of thing that leads you to make an adjust
ment like that.  If we would 
have had continuous strength throughout the second quarter, it would be one thing, but as it is, we had one month of large increase in April, and then May was moderate, and June was low.  
And to come out now and say, well, that adds up to an overshoot and we™re going to correct for it, I don™t think I could understand that.   And I also can™t understand it in an environment where we have 7-1/2 percent 
unemployment, where we just had a GNP number
 released by Commerce
--right or wrong--that was very much lower than it was before; and wher
e you are utilizing only 80 percent of materials 
capacity, according to our new revised index of mate
rials.  It would be a very difficult thing for me to justify, so I feel very strongly agai
nst reducing the range that you specified.  Now-- 7/19-20/76 - 54 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me just interrupt to
 simply amplify what you said, actually.  
Here are the figures for M1, starting in March 1975, when we first begin making decisions under 
the concurrent resolution:   Between March 1975 and the second quarter of 1976, which includes the overshoot, the annual rate of growth was 5.6 percent.   From the second quarter of ™75 to the s
econd quarter of ™76, it was 5.2 percent.   The third quarter of ™75 to the second quarter of ™76 was 4.5 percent.   The fourth quarter of ™75 to the second quarter of ™76 was 5.5 percent.   That overshoot gets lost. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I know.  If I may just interject a question in here that I think lies behind this:  Were you happy or unhappy with the overshoots or undershoots?  And I 
happen to be happy with the earlier undershoots.  If we had not had the overshoot last quarter, in fact to an extreme we had an undershoot, would 
Governor Partee, consistent with his position, be 
in favor of raising the ranges now? MR. PARTEE.  Yes, in the economic situati
on I would.  But we don™t have fortunately-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No, I understand but, consistent with your position, I think you would have to get a higher range. MR. PARTEE.  Now, in M2 and M3, Mr. Chairman, I™m a little uncomfortable with 
reducing the upper limit on those because, if not 
worded just right, it might be taken as an 
indication that we do not wish to see a further substantial recovery in housing--M3 particularly is associated in the public mind with housing.  And 
the fact of the matter 
is that, with a 9 to 11 percent range in M3, there is plenty of money to finance anyt
hing that even I see in housing, much less the staff--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  To say nothing about the liquidity that has been built up. 
MR. PARTEE.  That™s what has to be negotiated now.  I am inclined to believe that 
Kichline™s right, that we have high ranges here.  
And literally speaking, what we ought to do is to 
reduce the lower limit of the range because chances
 are, if interest rates do move up, we are 
going to fall below the lower limits of these rang
es.  I™m not quite prepared to do that partly 
because that I™m not sure interest rates are goi
ng to move up very much this fall.  But a little 
move I think is probably justified.  So, in s
hort, I accept the overshoot, and I accept your 
specifications on long-range growth rates. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee.  Mr. Mayo, please. MR. MAYO.  Well, Governor Partee has finally
 made my speech for me all the way down 
the line.  I™m not troubled by the overshoot.  I think that [unintelligible] should be more broadly 
7/19-20/76 - 55 - 
measured.  I have the same uncomfortable fee
ling that Chuck mentioned with regard to the 
housing thing, but I see no great difficulty in explaining that to the general public.   I have a slight qualm as to the 
tactics.  We did explain to th
e general public that one of the reasons for moving the M1 range down last time
 was that there were new factors coming into 
parts of M2 that were really M1 in a way, and that [there were] movements out of demand 
deposits--corporate sweeps and so forth.  We are now
 silent on that subject, and it might look 
inconsistent to people who view
 our reduction of the targets on M2 and M3 and keeping the target on M1 as a reversal of the previous explanation.  But I don™t think that that should cause us any trouble.   I must say I find empty the suggestion that we make a change now because it would be 
hard to do a change three months from now.  I do
n™t consider that any of us around this table is capable of judging the precise environment in whic
h this discussion will take place three months 
from now, regardless of when you may be aske
d to testify.  I am quite willing to be a 
procrastinator on that particular phase of decisionmaking today, so I would support the 
recommendation you have made Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Kimbrel, may we have your views? 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, I guess [I™m] bi
ased towards an anti
cipation of a stronger renewed expansion than would appear in some quart
ers.  Associated with that is my continuing 
anxiety about general price stability and the concern for the difficulty that we could experience 

later this year with a necessity for a larger degree
 of firming if we fail to take some modest move 
now.  I could accept these ranges you suggest wit
hout difficulty.  If I had my druthers, though, I 
think I would prefer a half point reduction in [the lower limits 
of] M1 and M2 [as well as on the topside], resulting in ranges of 4 to 7 and 7 to 9-1/2. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimbrel.  Mr. Coldwell. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I came prepar
ed for a further notch at the bottom of 
this, bringing [M1] down to 4 to 7 and [M2 down to] 7 to 10.  I have listened to the discussion, and I have looked over the alternatives that the staff has prepared.  If I could really believe alternatives A, B, and C, I have to say that the trade-off with the rate of inflation is not materially 
different, and the trade-off in the unemployment ra
te seems to be somewhat better.  I don™t feel 
the high 6 rate on unemployment is an accepta
ble rate for the long-range package we™re 
[considering] through 1977.   However, I don™t think the forecast takes 
into account the possibilities of new 
congressional stimulus, so I suspect we™re going 
to get some there anyway.  And consequently, 
I™m not quite so disturbed about that.  I can ac
cept the rates that you suggested with lowering the upper end.  Actually I would prefer to lower the bottom end of the targets and leave the upper 
end where it was and provide a li
ttle greater flexibility.   
But I do think Henry has put his finger on some
thing [on which] we need to do careful analysis, and that is the stickiness of the federa
l funds rate.  And I™m not being facetious when I 
suggest we might consider a z
one of indifference in the federal funds rate as we do on the 7/19-20/76 - 56 - 
monetary aggregates.  Perhaps reduce our sensitivity to some
 of the overshoots and undershoots on monetary aggregates and the sensitivity of the market to a particular rate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, I thank you.  I™ll just comment on the last.  There may be 
a good time for experimenting along those lines, 
but I would hate to do it in any immediate 
future because you can upset the markets, and no one
 can be sure of the consequences of a zone 
of indifference for the federal funds rate.  The consequences could be very serious in financial markets.  They could be beneficial over the 
long run, but I would antici
pate a difficult learning process. MR. COLDWELL.  We have enoug
h upset with the changes in the market in reaction to 
what we™ve been doing over the past 90 days. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yeah, but you know the minor wiggles in the market make 
headlines today and they™re forgotten tomorro
w.  The same thing might happen under your 
suggestion.  Well, I think it™s a thoughtful comment, and we ought to consider it and have it 
studied by our own staff, and possibly we ought to [bring in] some market specialists to discuss 
various possibilities and get their reaction.  And we would do that without indicating anything about our specific thinking  since we can discuss a range of possibilities and get their reaction.  They™d have no way of knowing which way we want to come out, or perhaps we ourselves at that time wouldn™t know the way we 
want to come out.  We want 
to learn.  Well, thank you very 
much. MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, wh
en are you testifying on this? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  On the 27th of this m
onth.  I think it™s this coming Tuesday.  
That™s a week from today. 
MR. WINN.  I was thinking that, while we adjust
 to the second quarter, the market is going 
to adjust to the latest reporting data
 that we give out on the aggregates. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the market will when
 I testify--when will the June report be 
released, Mr. Broida?  
MR. BROIDA.  The June report gets releas
ed this Friday.  It will be July 23. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, that will be pretty much on the minds of some members of the 
[congressional] committee, and its staff will exam
ine this report undoubtedly, and questions will 
be passed on to members of the committee.  In fact
, I will have to reread that report myself for 
preparation. MR. WINN.  How do you show no change in
 policy under those circumstances, because 
we are kind of hung either way we move.  It™s kind of a lose-lose situation.  If you really go back to the second quarter, it would indicate that we ought to move a 
little bit.  On the other hand, I expect it would be easier to explain that we kept the percentages right where we had them.  This 
week™s data plus the June data are the things they™re going to look at. 7/19-20/76 - 57 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There will
 be talk all over the lot,
 I™m sure.  I hope to be adequately prepared. 
MR. WINN.  I™d stay with it. 
 I think what Chuck Partee-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Winn.  Mr. Gardner? 
MR. GARDNER.  I would encourage you to have mo
re debate about this federal funds rate issue in the substitution for other evidence in the [unintelligible].  I may be at odds with most of 
my colleagues on this.  You know, the federal funds rate can go from nothing to what have you 
depending on the supply of federal funds in the mark
et, and I think an exercise to try to remove 
market curiosity from our actions will probably be futile.  But I™m not so certain of my own 

views that I don™t think we all will benefit by some further disc
ussion, because many of us have 
expressed concern about the markets™ sensitivity to 
our actions in the federal funds market, etc.  I 
would welcome that, Mr. Chairman.   
Number 2, I have to say, Bruce, that in matte
rs of the kind we are discussing today, with the pause that none of us really believes [exists] in the economy, I just can™t believe [the argument] that it™s an appropriate
 time to act because it™s easier
 now than it may be later, when 
we [are] a little more persuaded of exactly what our consensus view is.  Sure, we™ve got a pause 

in the economy, let™s be sure we don™t have a real pause in the economy.  In summary, Mr. 
Chairman, I™m very persuaded by Governor Partee, 
and I associate my remarks with his that we 
stay where we are. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  With regard to M1 or also on M2 and M3? 

MR. GARDNER.  Well, I™m not as sensitive 
to lowering the upper limit of M2 and M3, 
and I™m willing to accept that. 
MR. PARTEE.  I do, too. 
MR. GARDNER.  I thought you did. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I thought you did, but I wasn™t entirely sure.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Baughman. MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, it seems 
to me that it should be possible to 
characterize the conditions in alternative B--which are essentially the same as those described in 
your recommendation--as a no-change posture, and 
it seems to me that™s what the current 
environment really calls for.  A
nd I™m for not extending it beyond that. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Would anyone else like to speak? 
MR. JACKSON.  I would like to add just one more reason for reducing the limits on M2 
and M3, and that is the changing financial technology that has been discussed here today.  It would make at least logical [sen
se to] say that, as these other measures become substitutes for 
7/19-20/76 - 58 - 
transaction-type purposes, they will naturally be more closely equated to M1, which we have long thought of as [a] transactions measure [of money]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s an
 increase in velocity. MR. JACKSON.  So therefore, for that reason, the rates of growth are not as necessary to sustain [given] patterns of activity, and that would encourage us to at least bring [those rates] 
down slightly. MR. ROOS.  Perhaps I should understand--if we were to take a position of maintaining the 
same ranges and apply those to the first quarter ba
se instead of moving it up, would that signal to 
the public and to the markets a greater degree of rest
raint?  In other words, that wouldn™t give the 
same impression that we™re holding the line? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think that would be the reaction.  But what would trouble me 
more is that we would be charged with altering our techniques--manipulating to choose one base 
at one time, and the other time we choose another 
base.  That would be most unfortunate.  Now, we may want to change our procedure, but if 
we do it [unintelligible] that would hold for an 
indefinite future, and the indefinite future may be simply, oh, another year or so or two.  But we 
would be charged with manipulating and ch
icanery, and I™m so sure of that.   Now we™re going to be charged by some with
 being stupid because of the overshoot.  I 
don™t mind that nearly so much as the charge of 
chicanery.  We can survive a charge of stupidity, particularly if we™re confident that our basic poli
cy is right, as I do, because that charge will not 
last.  But in a world that has become so suspicio
us, particularly of government officials, and with 
so many critics of the Federal Reserve charging us with secrecy and what not, I would be terribly 

concerned about a charge of manipulation. 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, as I indicated ear
lier, I subscribe to what you say, but there have been columnists that have accused us of th
at in situations like this.  Some of the more 
sophisticated ones will say, for example, that we
 have really eased up more because we are 
starting from a higher base now.  For this reason, I prefer the sort of thing they™ll approve as 
suggested, which is hard to explain. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I do think that we w
ill have to do more explaining this time, 
perhaps, than we have in the past to minimize this
 interpretation or criticis
m.  We can™t prevent it 
or eliminate it.  If we were God™s angels 
on earth, we wouldn™t mi
nimize it beyond a point.   
Well, gentlemen, I think we are ready to do some
 voting.  I think that the majority of the 
Committee favors leaving the range for M1 where it is
, but I think we ought to test that.  Will the 
members of the Committee be good enough to indicat
e whether they are reasonably content with leaving the range at 4-1/2 to 7. MR. BROIDA.  Ten.   

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™m
 reasonably content if we are going to reduce some 
of them. 
7/19-20/76 - 59 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we do these one by one, and then we can take the package together.  Now there™s more--it™s somewhat less clear about M2
--though I think that, looking at the summary, the majority seems to favor a range
 of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, which means reducing the 
upper limit of M2 by 1/2 a percentage point.  Let™s 
have a show of hands on 
that range, 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 for M2. MR. BROIDA.  Eight.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And again, I think a clear majority seems to favor a range of 9 to 
11 for M3, which would mean a reduction of the uppe
r limit by 1 percentage point.  Let us test 
that.  The range of 9 to 11.  How many 
would be reasonably content with that? MR. BROIDA.  Eleven.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think we are ready for a formal vote then.  Well, I™m advised by 
Mr. Broida--whose counsel I invariably take, but other members of the Committee need not 
follow me, obviously--that we have not voted on th
e longer-range targets formally in the past, 
and by implication we should not do so at the present time. 
MR. PARTEE.  I don™t understand why; however, I™m repeating history by saying that.  
The same thing came up last time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I must say I hear th
e explanation each time, and I understand it 
when it™s made, but I forget it a minute after. 
MR. WALLICH.   Mr. Chairman, it seems to me
 that, for those who might like to dissent, 
[we should have] some way--not, perhaps, in the 
way of formal votes--to l
eave the record clear. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, now, Mr. Br
oida will state his re
asons, and we will go on 
to Mr. O™Connell. MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, the last time th
is was discussed it was pointed out that we have a suit in court under which we may be ordere
d to release our specifications immediately.  It was also pointed out that you testify typically a week after the m
eeting, and that if we were to vote on these formally, we would be releasing th
e long-run specifications the week before your testimony.  Now, of course, the Committee is free to vote on it anytime.  But that was the 
consideration that led to the decisi
on not to vote formally last time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, they sound like convincing reasons.  I didn™t recall that at all.  Mr. O™Connell. MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman I heard that th
at was the earlier explanation given, and it had no [unintelligible], and there™s no reason w
hy there couldn™t be a vote on these long-range 
figures.  At the same time, there are modes of
 announcing a dissenting position other than the 
vote--the point the Governor made.  I see 
no need for a vote for accommodating Governor 
Wallich™s point. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What is th
e judgment of the Committee? 
7/19-20/76 - 60 - 
MR. GARDNER.
  Mr. Chairman, you™ve had a major
ity vote, if we can trust the 
Secretary™s count, which I™m sure we can, and 
I was waiting for Mr. O™Connell to say what he 
said.  It seems to me that those who wish to 
express the dissent on any one of these particular 
issues [may do so], since we™ve already determin
ed that the majority of the Committee concurs 
with the long-range target. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have some difficulty wi
th that.  In the monthly policy record, we 
record dissents on formal votes only. 
MR. BROIDA.  The distinction is whether th
e people who disagree with these long-run targets would be named.  If there is no formal
 vote, we would indicate that three members 
favored a different long-run range.  And we™d use today™s discussion as a basis for that.  If there™s a formal vote, they would be named. 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, I must say, Mr. Chairman, I don™t find the arguments very 
persuasive.  We don™t have a court decision.  I think if we had court decision it would apply to every specification we had:  the funds rate, the short-range target for the Ms as well as the long-
range.  And if we had to as a matter of fact, I™m 
inclined to think that there would be less public 
damage from reporting, say, our funds rate sp
ecifications for the very next period.   And so I just don™t find anything [about] the long-range expectations that is so much more 
sensitive than the short-range that we should have this special system, and I do believe that there 
should be an opportunity for a Committee member 
to dissent from long-range specifications 
because he doesn™t think it is [what] the ec
onomy needs, and therefore I think we should 
introduce a vote on this. MR. JACKSON.  There™s a legal question only.  As pertains to this meeting that we™re 
having right now, is there any likely prospect that a court would order the immediate release of 
this vote prior to the testimony scheduled for the 27th? 
SPEAKER(?).  Quite frankly, the answer is no. 

MR. JACKSON.  Then I would like to suggest a pragmatic solution, that the decision be 
made [for] this meeting to go ahead and have 
the vote because the possibilities of damages or 
consequence are sufficiently remote as to not ov
erweigh the merits, apparently, of some people™s 
wishes to dissent. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let™s see whether we ha
ve a practical problem or not.  Assuming 
that we took a formal vote, would any member of 
the Committee be definitely inclined to dissent 
from a decision to have M1 at 4-1/2 to 7, a
nd M2 at 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, and M3 at 9 to 11? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Le
t me make a comment in general.  I wouldn™t be 
inclined to dissent for this one.  I would be perfectly happy to have a discussion that reflected some of the varying considerations, but the 
actual vote somehow puts you in a more rigid 
position than maybe the discussion in this particular
 case justifies.  So I can see some advantage 
in not having a vote, but the particular reasons cited [for not having a vote] don™t seem any more 
persuasive to me than
 to Governor Partee. 7/19-20/76 - 61 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think in 
view of the apparent path that no one is clearly inclined to dissent at this meeting, I would suggest that 
we not have a formal vote 
today but that we give the most serious consideration to ha
ving a formal vote in the future.   
MR. COLDWELL.  I don™t have any problem with
 that Mr. Chairman.  I do think that it 
seems strange that we don™t have a formal
 vote on long-range targets.  We™re having it 
announced as being future policy. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We tested the opinion of
 the Committee, and apparently there will 
be no dissent, but one or another of us may still ch
ange his mind, and I would leave that to a later 
meeting and proceed today the way we have thus fa
r this year.  But I don™t feel strongly on the 
issue.  I think the considerations I have in mind, without sp
elling them out, ar
e rather obvious.  How many would want a formal vot
e today?  Members only.  How many would prefer a formal 
vote today? MR. BROIDA.  Two, Mr. Chairman, three. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s postpone that in view of the majority sentiment.  And I 
do think we ought to move toward formal voting. 
 I agree with Mr. Partee and Mr. Coldwell.  Who™s the third one?  Mr. Balles.   
Well, how many would be in favor, in principle, 
of formal voting, not as
 of today but in the future.  All right, I™m with you completely on 
it.  I would prefer not to do it today.   Well, all right, then, I think that we had bett
er break for lunch and come back and pick up 
the shorter-run targets and the directive.  If we try to do it now I think we might hurry and rush 
it.  I think some of you will want to catch a plane, and you may have made arrangements; 

therefore, 2:15. [Lunch recess] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, there™s one it
em we have to return to in connection 
with the longer-range targets, and that is a growth range for the credit proxy.  I suggest that we proceed as we did last time and leave that deci
sion to our staff--that decision to be consistent 
with the money growth ranges that we™ve agreed
 upon.  Is that suggesti
on agreeable?  I hear no 
objections; we™ll proceed that way.   Now, we should hear from Mr
. Sternlight on what the Desk has done recently.  Mr. Sternlight, please. MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Secretary's note: Th
is statement was not found in Committee 
records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Sternlight.  Are there any questions? MR. WALLICH.  On your nonborrowed reserves 
exercise, I thought that the idea was not to look through to the aggregates, but here, if I™ve understood you correctly, you implied that you 7/19-20/76 - 62 - 
had been operating on that basis.  Is that becau
se you concluded that it isn™t feasible not to look 
through? MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, we try to envisage what the Committee might want us to do.  
It seems to me it™s been the case 
right along that one could pursue this with different degrees of rigidity.  In this case, we thought that it would 
 have been more in keeping with the Committee™s 
desire if we were to look partly through and not tighten against the background of weaker 
aggregates. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, I regard 
it as a hopeful development, given that the experiment, it 
seems to me, has not worked all that well.  
Do you feel you are exploring a path to better performance there? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, I think we were 
trying to envisage how we would actually have operated, on the assumption that the Commit
tee likes to make its moves, I think, in 
deliberate and gradual fashion and not shock th
e market with sudden new innovations.  This 
seemed the more reasonable approach to a change in technique rather than something that would 

abruptly change the rules of the game. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, Mr. Black. 

MR. BLACK.  Peter, there were three things th
at struck me this morning in the news that 
might have significant effects upon the market™s e
xpectation regarding interest rates.  And I wonder if you could comment on that--one is a sh
arp drop in gold prices; [second] another sharp plunge in futures prices in a number of commodi
ties; and then the third thing would be the release of GNP figures somewhat lower than I think the market was probably expecting.  Will 

this have much impact, do you think? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think all of those could be in a direction of moderating inflationary 
expectations--I don™t know that they would be of
 enormous impact.  The markets were about 
steady this morning on the early reports that we got.  I think the GNP number was just about in line with what had been anticipated in some ear
lier guesses about the second quarter.  So, I think it™s in the direction of
 moderating inflationary expectations but no large impact anticipated. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right,
 any other questions or comments?  If not, we need to 
ratify the operations of the Desk.  Is there a motion to that effect? 
 Motion been made.  I hope it™s 
been seconded.  It actually has been seconded.  I hear no objection.   Now, does the Bluebook raise questions of a kind that we need to turn to an economist to 
clarify?  Or does the Bluebook answer its own questi
ons?  Or are the difficulties of the sort that no economist can help us on?  We have an econo
mist standing by, ready to answer questions on 
the Bluebook.  Are there any?   
All right, we will proceed then to our domestic policy directive and to its specification of 
the monetary aggregates and the federal funds 
rate for the month ahea
d.  Who would like to speak first?  Mr. Coldwell please. 7/19-20/76 - 63 - 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I™d be perfectl
y willing to stay with alternative B the way it™s written. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good-- 
[NOTE:  Several members, including Balle
s and Black, indicate their agreement.] 
MR. JACKSON.  Same. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™m going to be a 
little unhappy.  The federal funds rate now is at 5-1/4.  I, for one, would not like to see it drop by 50 basis points over the next month, nor 
would I like to see it rise by 50 basis points over the next month.  And as for the growth ranges 
[of the monetary aggregates], I™d like to see thes
e upper limits just sligh
tly lower than specified, but my feelings there are less strong than with re
gard to the interest rates.  Mr. Mayo, then Mr. Volcker. MR. MAYO.  I have the same feeling you 
do, Mr. Chairman, on the ranges for the 
aggregates.  I think 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 in B is too high.  The 4 to 8 under alternative C is all right, but I wouldn™t even mind shading that 
a little bit.  I don™t see any necessity of placing our upper limit 
any higher, really, than 7-1/2 as a practical matter.  However, I would keep the federal funds rate 
range of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, but I would adopt the money market directive wording, which I think 
would work in the direction of keeping the rate closer to the 5-1/4 percent, where it is now. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Mr. Volcker. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™d start the other way around on interest rates, as I guess you did, and I preface my comment with a note that
 our own projections 
in New York of the aggregates are lower than the Board™s, as they were last time.  Last time, 
reality, of course, came 
out lower than both by a considerable margi
n, but against the longer-range background, I wouldn™t like to see the federal funds rate going down to 4-3/4 percent, and unless things really went haywire, I wouldn™t particularly like to see it go below the 5-
1/4 that we are at now.  A range of 5 to 5-3/4 might summarize the view
; it puts the midpoint a 
little above 5-1/4. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we could [have] asymmetry, you see.  That is, 5-1/4 being considered as the central rate, it could go down to 5 or go up 5-3/4.  We™ve done that before.  I 
don™t see any difficulty in doing it, if th
at were the wish of the Committee. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The ranges [for the 
aggregates], I feel a little bit trapped 
with [them].  We just set some long-term range
s, which we are below, so you could argue the logic is to let them go up a little bi
t in the short-run to get within the ranges we just established.  I 
would not press the logic--not having agreed with putting the range that I would prefer, something like [in alternative ] C, which spre
ads the long-term range that we have.  And it doesn™t make it quite so likely that we woul
d be pushing interest rates further down for a temporary period.  So I would [fa
vor] something like the C ranges 
on aggregates.  And more of a 
downward constraint in the federal funds rate; and a money market directive. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Mr. Partee, please. 7/19-20/76 - 64 - 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairma
n, I think there™s a good possibility that July is going to be a strong month for the monetary aggregates
.  We started the month, as the newspapers 
reported, with a very strong week, and it seems to 
me quite conceivable that what we have was a 
surprising June sluggishness in the money supply that was associated with the change in the fiscal year, and that July will begin to bring b
ack that strength.  Therefore, I think that the 
Committee ought to be alert to th
e possibility that as it drops these ranges on M1, it thereby increases the probability of moving up in whatever federal funds 
rate range is specified.  I guess I could [accept] the 4 to 8 M1, but I don™t think 
I™d like to drop it as far as President Mayo, down 
to 7-1/2.  We could have a somewhat lower M2 range, though I don™t know that that™s so 

significant.  As far as the funds rate is concerned, I don™t see any reason to prejudge, to have a nonsymmetrical-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The only point about that is, if we were to adopt the suggestion--this is hypothetical--to have a range of 5 to 5-3/4, the midpoint would be 5-3/8, and 
therefore it means an immediate or an early in
crease to the central 
point, and why do that? MR. PARTEE.  Well, then, let me respecify. 
 I don™t see why we should allow for more room on the upside of where we are now in the 
funds rate than we do on the downside of where we are now because I can™t say, given the economi
c information and the reasons for the behavior 
of the aggregates, that there™s more prospect of 
moving in one direction than another in the short run.  Therefore, I would prefer the 4-3/4 to 5-
3/4, perhaps with an understanding that we™re not going to use the far ends of range. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but we™ve agreed not to do that.  The range that we specify is the range that we should be ready to use unle
ss there is some significant factor that will lead 
us-- MR. PARTEE.  Well, then, I would be prepared 
to pick 5 to 5-1/2, but I find it a little odd, since just this morning we were talking about th
e need to have more variation in the federal 
funds rate. CHAIRMAN BURNS That was one view expressed. MR. PARTEE.  Well, I think it was pretty gene
rally, a lot of people want to subscribe to it-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh, no-- 

MR. JACKSON.  Let me ask a factual question of 
the Desk, Mr. Chairman.  Would you 
move to the limits on the federal funds range unl
ess the aggregates were clearly outside the ranges? MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, I think our approach there has been to observe a zone of indifference within which we don™t make any move 
at all; then as we see the aggregates moving 
toward the tops or bottoms of their ranges, maki
ng some move in the federal funds rate; and at 
the point where the aggregates are reaching the ex
tremes, then going to the top or bottom of the 
funds rate range. 7/19-20/76 - 65 - 
MR. PARTEE.  So even if they were right up at the extreme, you would expect by the end 
of the period to have a funds rate right up at the extreme? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s the rule under which we operate. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™d like to throw a suggestion in that I was tempted to 
make last time on precisely this point, and I™m ra
ther sorry I didn™t, in retrospect.  The way you weigh M1 [relative to] M2 is somewhat trouble
some.  But it seems to me that, in some 
circumstances, and this may be one of them, 
one way of approaching it would be to say you 
don™t move to the extremes unless you get confirma
tion in both these measures.  That if M1 or 
M2 went above or below the range, that in itself wouldn™t push you to action until it™s confirmed 
by the other moving in the same way.  Last 
time, I guess we had M1 going below the range 
whereas M2 stuck within it, and in fact was above the midpoints 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now wait.  M2 revived only toward the end of the month. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes, revived toward the end, I agree.  For a while it was below the middle-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well below the middle. 

MR. PARTEE.  It was never out of the range, though, as M1 was. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 
 It was never out of it.  For a while it was low, and then it actually got back in the high side of the range. MR. STERNLIGHT.  No, just to the mi
ddle, it didn™t get to the high side. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  The middle range-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have some difficulty 
with that.  You know, we must not become 
too mathematical, too mechanical.  We must l
eave some elbow room to the Desk.  We should 
avoid excessive fine tuning.  I think our instru
ction to the Desk recently has been to give 
approximately equal weight to the two.  We leave it to the Desk to interpret that.  I would rather 

do that than proceed by more mechanical formula. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I agree with all the sentiment you™re ex
pressing, and I guess I think it™s less mechanical than doing it 
the other way, on occasion, leaving some 
discretion to the Desk at the same time.  I f
eel you get kind of a mech
anical averaging here which may not always be
 suitable to the--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I also have the feeling that we ought to stay with a certain rule for a little while until misery, frustration p
iles up, and then we go to another rule, and misery 
and frustration pile up.  We shouldn™t change from month to month. 
MR. PARTEE.  I don™t quite understand the logic, Paul, of waiting until both [M1 and M2] are out [of their specified ranges].  It seems to im
ply a knowledge as to the effect of the behavior of these aggregates on the economy that I, at least, don™t have. 
7/19-20/76 - 66 - 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh, I think either way, that™s-- MR. PARTEE.  I know, but you know-- 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don™t profess any great knowledge of the behavior. MR. PARTEE.  I take it you™re saying that not only M1, but M1 and M2 must be beyond the bounds; or not only M2, but also M1 must be beyond the bounds. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Because maybe you get shifts between the two, as we 
had said at ample length this morning.  You 
know, how do you interpret it when one™s going in one direction and the other in the other direction?  Is an arit
hmetic average really better? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we want 
reach a decision, and who would like to express--we haven™t heard from many members of the Board.  Unless others want to speak, I™m 
going to make the suggestion that we adopt the 
alternative C ranges for M1 and M2 and a range of 5 to 5-1/2 for the federal funds rate.  And if we do that we ought to have a money market 
directive.  But last month we decided to be i
llogical; I think being ill
ogical now and then is defensible, but to be illogical month after month is
 a little harder to defend.  So if we took a 
narrow federal funds rate, I really think we ought to have a money market directive. 
MR. PARTEE.  But then it™s hard to explain why it is we changed it.  You have the same 
funds rate range last time--that is, the same half
 point and we called that a monetary aggregate directive and now with the same range we call it a 
money market directive. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Two wrongs don™t make a right. 

SPEAKER(?).  It™s more flexible. 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Frustration™s built up. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think 
an explanation can be worked out.  It wouldn™t make 
anybody happy.  Yes, Mr. Balles. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, since I was 
about the fourth one, I guess, to follow Governor Coldwell™s proposal for alternative B as written, I™ve really got to say something on 
that federal funds range to the effect that a half point is, in my opinion, fa
r too narrow.  Those of us who served on the Subcommittee 
on the Directive ended up with a pretty firm conviction that 
overly close management of the funds rate wa
s leading to these undershoots and overshoots.  And I™d like just to see a better balance between th
e two.  I™d settle for a 1 point spread, but when it gets down to a half, I really feel very uncomfortable, and for some
 of the reasons that Governor Wallich was speaking to this morning. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, speaking for myself
 in the present environment, I could live 
even with a narrower range.  Why do we want
 oscillating interest rates in the present 
environment?  What advantage would we ga
in?  Why not wait until 
trends clarify?   
7/19-20/76 - 67 - 
Now, we talk about the federal funds rate, bu
t there are people in the marketplace who see 
fortunes made and fortunes broken and business 
thriving or business slumping as a result of these interest rate movements.  Now, we ought 
to be sure of our ground before we take moves 
with regard to interest rates.  Markets have gotten into a mechanical habit, unfortunately, and we 
are responsible for it.  [First, the] federal funds 
rate moves, then the whole family of short-term 
interest rates moves, then three weeks later or some
 interval like that the prime rate moves; in the 
meantime the stock exchanges react.  Are we
 doing something constructive by bobbing up and 
down?  Well, these are my doubts. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I have the same fee
ling.  I™d just add to that, Mr. Chairman, that I think, inevitably, whether we like 
it or not, we give a pretty strong signal if we move by more than a quarter here 
in either direction.  And the mark
et is going to interpret it as a strong signal, and I don™t think this is the time for strong signals. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly
 think this discussion reinforces your comment this morning that we need to have a 
session where we discuss this at more length-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --and when we are less tired than we are this afternoon.  I think we should plan for that-- MR. BAUGHMAN.  I have to register a little 
different view, I guess, and fill in also an 
observation that at least some of
 the bigger bankers in the Southwest think that, in view of the 
loan demand situation, they are look
ing at interest rate weakness rather than interest rate strength for the immediate future, whatever that is.  And it 
seems to me that if we embrace a very narrow 
or point interest rate target, we are in effect saying that we ca
n predict interest rates--that is, what 
would be the normal path of in
terest rates in this uncertain
 economic picture--with greater 
accuracy or dependability than we
 can predict most any of the 
other great array of economic 
variables.   That--along with John Balles™s observations that historically, at least, riding the funds rate fairly tightly seems to have imparted greater 
volatility to the aggreg
ates--would lead me to 
urge--though I can™t vote on it--that the Committee 
conclude that there should be a fair amount 
of range on the interest rate so that the Manager could begin to respond to sizable or cumulative 
deviations from the objective on the 
aggregates.  It seems to me th
at, historically at least, it would seem to have given us a li
ttle better record.  That leads 
me also to have sympathy for a 
monetary aggregate directive rather
 than a money market directive. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you. 
MR. WALLICH.  I can see many reasons why 
one would want to narrow the funds rate now, but the consequence of doing that is that one increasingly gets married to a narrow funds 
rate range, and the problems that come from that
 escalate.  Each time it becomes more critical 
not to have the funds rate go too far; more short-run [unintelligible] effects come from that, and 
there is probably never a good time 
to broaden the funds rate [range].  Therefore, I believe that we ought to accept this painful discipline and stay 
with least the 1 percentage point range; 4-3/4 
to 5-3/4 looks right to me. 7/19-20/76 - 68 - 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I pointed out a co
uple of years ago that there seems to be 
something of a seasonal aberration in the figures 
in the third quarter, wh
en we typically get a decline in the rate of growth of M1, M2, and M3.  We may not get it this
 year, but I would be surprised if we get quite the strength in the aggregates that some people think we may get, and I 
would like a little more leeway to move [the fede
ral funds rate] down if, in fact, the aggregates do come in weaker. 
MR. JACKSON.  I would argue, Mr. Chairman, 
that now would be a good time to broaden 
the range.  Using M1 as an example, we see 
April at 14.9, May at 6.4, and June at negative 1.2.  If July and the projections for August would indicate something below the 4 we™re discussing, I 
would argue that 1/2 point would not be too much.   
Conversely, if we see the figures for that period going back into the 8 range, I would argue that a 1/2 point on the top side would not be t
oo much.  Because if we see the figure coming in 
low, it would tend to substantiate the June experience, which we really have some question 
about, and properly so.  Conversely, if we see them coming up in 
the high range, this would tend to add validity to the April-May trend we saw and [imply] that June was in fact a statistical or 
maybe some other freakish type of situation that
 was not reflective of the underlying strengths.  And therefore I would argue that using the full range would be a good thing to do under these circumstances. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Even if the 
variations in growth rates reflected in large part merely 
movement from the public to the Treasury and [t
hen] back from the Tr
easury to the public? 
MR, JACKSON.  To a certain extent the 
Desk has offset those by its actions. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yeah.  I think this is perhaps a very large part of the explanation.  Why should we [unintelligible] some markets if that
 is what is going on?  
Well, that is just a question.   The afternoon is drawing on.  I™m moved to reflect a little on the time interval.  Here we 
are, we meet once a month.  We™ve got to do some
thing during that month.  Now if we met every 
three months, which is what this Committee did 
some years ago, we could have a pretty wide 
federal funds rate range.  But meeting once a mont
h, and when there is some uncertainty as to 
which way things may move, do we really want to
 see-saw markets?  That™s my doubt.  This is 
going to be the Committee™s 
decision.  I™ve expressed my views.
  Who else would like to speak? 
MR. WINN.
  I think that, since our posture this morning was to indicate no change, I™d hope that our short-range objectives could be in the same sort of 
a pattern.  Therefore I™ve been associating myself with B, pretty well as given, and [with] the aggregate approach rather than the 
money market approach at this time. 
MR. MACLAURY.  I™d like to associate myself
 with Henry Wallich™s point, and Phil™s 
likewise:  a zone of indifference.  I don™t think we are debating it now, but that™s the direction in which I would like to move; maybe a half a point
 fed funds rate zone of indifference.   It seems to me that the Wednesday phenomenon
 is instructive in this connection.  The 
market did not react at all, as far as I know, to th
e fact that the funds rate got out of our supposed 7/19-20/76 - 69 - 
range of concern on Wednesday because they 
know that we don™t react, and it doesn™t mean 
anything.  And I would think that that could grad
ually be broadened to be not just a Wednesday phenomenon but a Monday through Friday phenomenon within a more limited band.  My own 

preference here--if we were looking for a comp
romise, [then] a compromise to me does seem 
like a 5 to 5-3/4 federal funds rate this time.  Th
at may not be totally consistent, but it™s working 
out. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™d be
 entirely happy with that. 
MR. GUFFEY.  I think, with respect to the funds rate, that 3/4 percent makes me feel 
better; 5 to 5-3/4 is a good range.  I woul
d like to point out--I guess it™s obvious to everybody--that if we talk about alternative C, which would be my option, we are actually 
increasing the aggregate limits for M1 and M2.  That is to say, for last month, they will be 

published as being 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, and we™re talking about an alternative C of 4 to 8.  I don™t know how the market reads that or what it lead
s to, but my preference would be alternative C 
with a 5 to 5-3/4 range on the federal funds [rate]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other? 
MR. GARDNER.  I think that narrowing the band gives me some concern.  Just being 
totally pragmatic, I impute a publ
ic reaction to levels of interest rates perhaps more than 
[unintelligible] because of my 
prior experience.  I would not wa
nt to see us up at 6 or down below 5.  Therefore, I think there™s some rationale
 for not narrowing the band but staying at 5 to 5-3/4 even though that is not symmetrical in terms of what we™d 
like to achieve; I think that the psychology of a 6 percent steady funds rate or something like that would be much too dramatic 
[unintelligible]. MR. PARTEE.  I didn™t understand Steve™s point.  We™ve been at 4-3/4, we™ve been at 
5-3/4, why do you want to skew the funds range? MR. GARDNER.  I don™t. 
MR. PARTEE.  You said 5 to 5-3/4.  I myself 
much prefer 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, giving a range of 1 point. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We are really ta
lking about very small differences. 
MR. COLDWELL.  With a 5 to 5-3/4 range your
 midpoint range is 5-3/8, and presumably 
the Desk would move to that. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, you could have asymmetry. MR. COLDWELL.  Then you change the gr
ound rules upon which the Desk operates. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we™ve done that. 
MR. COLDWELL.  We™ve done it in the past
, but I thought I just heard you [say] you 
didn™t want to change. 7/19-20/76 - 70 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I meant that I wo
uld, I don™t think we ought to--well, let me 
not try to explain that.  I think that we™ve done that in the past, a
nd that [is] something we may or 
may not want to do today. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Seem
s to me we lose a little 
sight, Mr. Chairman, of the 
one thing we are sure of--which is that these aggr
egates in this short-run perspective move very 
erratically.  You haven™t got any idea whether they are going to the upper end of the range or the lower end.  They™re likely to break one or the other. MR. PARTEE.  I think you have a little idea.  We know that they started out being strong.  There would be some presumption th
at it™s going to be strong.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think 
that™s a fair observation. MR. JACKSON.  I do, too. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, I think that
 we are first of all discussing minute 
differences; second, I sense fatigue all around this table, and therefore let me test one or two 
ranges and see what the thinking of the Committ
ee, or the inclination of the Committee, may 
be--I don™t know how much thinking we™re doing anymore.   
I™ll test the following:  4-3/4, 5-3/4, 5-1/2.  Now those who would prefer 4-3/4 to 5-3/4 as against the other two possibilities [for the federal funds rate], members of the Committee, would 
kindly raise their hand.   The other question--4-3/4 to 5-3/4 is one possibility; let me call it
 A.  B is 5 to 5-3/4.  C is 5 to 5-1/2.  Now if you are undecided you can raise your hand twice.  If you are still undecided you can raise your hand three times.  Mr. Broida w
ill have an accurate arithmetical count.  Those 
who would prefer A kindly raise your hands.  Eight.  Those who would prefer B kindly raise their hands.  One.  Those who prefer C kindly raise their hands.  Two.  Well, I think the majority 
of the Committee prefers a range of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4.   
Now, I don™t think we need to do much testing on monetary growth ranges.  I think that 
sentiment ran largely in favor of the magnitudes 
specified under alternat
ive C.  How many would 
be more or less content with the ranges
 under alternative C for M1 and M2?   
All right, next we have to decide on [whether] we prefer the money ma
rket directive or the monetary aggregate directive.  I think that in view of the federal funds rate range, the argument 
now tips in the direction of a mone
tary aggregate directive.  But 
let™s have a show of hands [of] those who would prefer a monetary 
aggregate directive as over agai
nst a money market directive.  
Eight.   Well, there is one small change in wording that
 I would like to make.  This is on line 5 of 
the draft of the directive.  Inst
ead of saying ﬁan apparent leveling outﬂ in the rate of inventory accumulation, have it read ﬁlittle changeﬂ in the 
rate of inventory accumulation.  Any objection 
to that? 
7/19-20/76 - 71 - 
MR. COLDWELL.  Between the first and second
 quarter Mr. Chairman?  I thought we had 
some evidence of rather sizable change
 in the inventory accumulation rate. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very small, very small. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  So we™ll vote on the following:  The monetary aggregates directive and the range fo
r M1 of 4 to 8; a range for M2 of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent; and the range for the federal funds rate of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, and 
we will give approximately identical weight to 
M1 and M2.  Any questions?  Apparen
tly not.  We are ready to vote. MR. BROIDA.

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, item 9 on the agenda
--in view of the absence of the authors 
of the memorandum on operations and Fannie Mae 
securities, the authors being Messrs. Axilrod and Holmes, I think we ought to postpone it.  
Gentlemen, I think we have done our business for 
the day. END OF MEETING
