Attended portion of meeting relating to the Committee's discussionof the economic outlook and its longer-run objectives for monetaryand debt aggregates.Transcript of Federal Open Market Committee Meeting ofJune 30-July 1, 1992June 30--Afternoon SessionCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's start with foreign currencyoperations. Mr. McDonough.MR. MCDONOUGH. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any questions for Mr. McDonough?MR. LINDSEY. I'm always struck by the purchasing powerparity basis. Further weakness in the dollar just doesn't seemjustified. Has that theory of exchange rates been routed or are weneglecting it? Why isn't that showing through in the markets?MR. MCDONOUGH. I think it's not routed completely, but it'scertainly less important now because of essentially speculativecapital flows based on interest rate differentials and views of stockmarkets. As I mentioned, I think what is hurting the dollar at thepresent time is the interest rate differential, which is clearlyagainst us, and a view that Wall Street may not be as attractive [aspreviously]. People are reading about the flows into equity mutualfunds slowing down and so on. The capital flow, which was really thesource of strength in the dollar, is slowing down; and that is givingus the weakness even though there's no question on a purchasing paritybasis that the dollar is far, far weaker than it should be.MR. TRUMAN. It may be, Governor Lindsey, that one of thereasons is that the conventional measures of purchasing power parityfor the DM and the yen are so far from where [exchange] rates havebeen for so long--2.10 for DM, 190 for the yen--that they've losttheir credibility as a benchmark even for such considerations. Still,we can imagine [tolerating]--if you want to put it that way--exchangerates at that level, and the associated current account deficits thatgo along with that. Now, that's one man's reaction to your question.I have been struck by the work that McKinnon has done at Stanford onthis. Two or more years ago there was some suggestion that we couldget back [to PPP] and, therefore, there was a lot of attention givento that issue. But with the dollar essentially [disconnected from anyanchor] on a purchasing power parity [basis] for such a long period oftime, it has lost its [relevance] and we should not use the word"anchor."MR. MELZER. Bill, you mentioned the market's expectationswith respect to what might come out in Munich in terms of multilateralintervention. Is there validity to that? Is that an expectation thathas some substance behind it?MR. MCDONOUGH. From what we hear, the Europeans don't haveany interest in any multilateral foreign exchange activity. And Ihaven't heard anything from the Treasury as to their planning to[undertake such operations]. But the market is quite convinced thatthere is going to be at least a U.S./Japanese accord, which theEuropeans will probably bless but not participate in.6/30-7/1/92MR. TRUMAN. The Europeans are somewhat divided. The FrenchI think will go along with anything, but the rest of the Europeanswill not. My sense from my own conversations with Treasury staff,unless their views have changed in the last several days, is that theyare not thinking of a deal, but one can never be quite sure when oneis dealing with the United States Treasury.MR. MCTEER. Under the circumstances in Japan, I'm not sure Iunderstand why they would want a stronger yen. I know it would dampinflationary pressures but it would also work against the real sector.MR. MCDONOUGH. I believe there are two factions, but theywind up in the same place coming from different directions. TheMinistry of Finance thinks that it will be very convenient for thempolitically in the bilateral relationship with the United States tohave a stronger yen. The Bank of Japan seems to have a very firm viewthat a stronger yen encourages capital flows into the stock market,and they would very much like a stronger stock market because of,among other things, the positive effect it would have on the tier-twocapital ratios of the Japanese banks.MR. MCTEER. I always thought that a strong currency didn'tencourage inflows but that the prospects of a stronger currency laterdid.MR. MCDONOUGH. I think what you say is accurate, but whatI've described is the position of the Bank of Japan, I'm quiteconvinced. They need not necessarily be right.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's not contradictory. If you arethe Bank of Japan and the yen is strong, the presumption is that theprobability of [the yen] getting stronger is higher than theprobability of it getting weaker. So, it's essentially the sameissue: at least that's what they're saying.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, it's especially true in stockmarkets. I was speaking to [unintelligible], which is what they'rehoping for.MR. JORDAN. That logic has a chicken and egg problem if theidea is that you want a stronger currency to help asset prices, butwhat is going on in that market [relates to] this purchasing powerparity in tradable goods, neglecting asset prices. The dominantfactor is what is going on in that system--weakness in real estate andequity and other asset prices--and the idea that they can do somethingwith the exchange rate to turn around asset prices doesn't wash.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions? If not, let's go tothe report from the Domestic Desk. Joan Lovett.MS. LOVETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--seeAppendix.]CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Ms. Lovett?MR. JORDAN. I was monitoring the "Call" this period and wasstruck by a couple of things. There were at least two occasions whenthe projection was for a need to add reserves but the funds rate was6/30-7/1/92trading down toward 3-5/8 percent. So, even though the projectionwould have called for adding reserves, at least tentatively theprogram was to drain reserves in order to avoid giving a false messageto the markets as to our intentions. And then there seemed to be somegaming going on in the Street by some banks that were bidding up thefunds rate just at the "Call" time. Whatever it was they were lookingat, they were thinking "Uh oh!" and trying to keep us from doing whatwe otherwise would have done.MS. LOVETT. Even though they didn't want to have to do that!MR. JORDAN. What is your reaction to that kind of heuristicaction-reaction? We would have wound up doing something in reservesupplying operations that really wasn't consistent with what we wantedto do because of this perception. And then they would have aperception on the other side regarding what we might do and try togame it in order to prevent us from doing it.MS. LOVETT. It's one of the foibles of having a federalfunds rate objective that gets narrower and narrower. That did happenon a couple of occasions and we didn't want to have to drain thereserves if we could avoid it. So, the fact that the perception outthere was that at certain rate levels and at certain times we didn'thave a tolerance [for actions] that would cause people to bid the rateup is part of what one has to call the "market dynamics."MR. JORDAN. You could now be in [a similar] position in theopposite direction. With the funds rate at 3-7/8 percent if you saw aneed to drain, [you would] feel compelled to add reserves--to dosomething that is not really consistent with supplying reserves--inorder to avoid giving a wrong signal.MS. LOVETT. Well, we have a little more flexibility on oneside of the rate depending on the state of market expectations. Thereisn't anyone out there who expects that the Committee is going to befirming policy, so there's more tolerance for a funds rate thatdeviates to the high side of the expected level than there would befor a funds rate that deviates to the low side. So, actually, we havethroughout this period felt somewhat more comfortable with having ouroperations be a little loose on the up side--that is, letting fundstrade at higher levels without necessarily going in and offsetting it.Whereas on the low side we wouldn't feel as comfortable because ifthere were any direction to policy in this period, that's the way themarket thinking has been.MR..JORDAN. That asymmetry, though, is due to marketperceptions that we are conditioned by real magnitudes; they thinkwe're responding to things we can't control anyway. But the follow-upquestion is this: Over this last week the market tried to [interpret]that failure to cut the funds rate, in a reserve supplying sense, as arelative tightening of policy. From the Desk perspective, would youview it as tighter?MS. LOVETT. The market has built in a good amount of the 25basis points.6/30-7/1/92MR. JORDAN. So, maintaining the funds rate is morerestrictive than lowering the funds rate given where the Street[thinking] is?MS. LOVETT. In fed funds terms, the market--MR. JORDAN. Well, [I mean] in terms of reserves. We have tosupply less or drain more in order to maintain the same funds rate,given where the yield curve is.MS. LOVETT. No, I don't think so.MR. KOHN. I'm not sure about that because the amount ofreserves is very small. I agree with Joan's earlier implicitassessment that if the Committee does not ease at this meeting,particularly if the employment data were on the soft side, short-termrates would back up a little. The market has built in a Fed reactionto the incoming data. I think that's equivalent to what you'resaying.MR. JORDAN. Not quite because I don't really interprettightening in terms of where the funds rate is. I really don't care[about that].MS. LOVETT. But the market does.MR. JORDAN. I do care about reserve operations. If theyield curve is under downward pressure, wouldn't you drain morereserves or supply fewer reserves than you would have otherwise inorder to support the same funds rate [objective]? In this recentperiod when the funds rate was trending down you were saying you saw aneed to ease but you actually were going to have to drain reserves tomaintain the same funds rate.MS. LOVETT. We may have to drain.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Syron.MR. SYRON. We have seen some improvement at the long end,with rates coming down. I was going to ask you--this may be unfair--to look at what has occurred since the last meeting, not on a day-to-day basis but rather on a week-to-week basis. We now have a long bondrate just a tad above 7-3/4 percent. How much of that is consistentwith the fairly steady pattern we're seeing of, if not softness, alack of firmness in the real sector and then a building in of furtherease in the market? Again, it comes down to the question ofexpectations. What I'm asking, and I'll try to be more direct aboutit, is: Do you view the improvement that we've seen in the long endfitting in with the market's expectation of what we might do?MS. LOVETT. You're right that there has been a better toneunderlying the long end of the market. And the barrier, which seemedto be 8 percent for the longest period of time, now seems to be 7-3/4percent. The long rate doesn't seem to be able to get through thatbarrier; it has been at about the 7.80 percent level, which is whereit was at the time of the last meeting also. So, there hasn't beentoo much net change over the full intermeeting period, even with thedecline--6/30-7/1/92MR. SYRON. I thought it went up after the [ previousdirective] came out indicating symmetric language and then--MS. LOVETT. Yes, and then it came back down.MR. SYRON. It came back down as the data weakened. Itdepends on where--MS. LOVETT. It's hard to say. The fact that the recoverydoesn't look robust certainly has been a factor in any improvement inthe long end of the market. But in discussing what the long end willdo [in response to] Fed policy, it usually turns on whether or not thelong rate is going to back up, not so much whether there's a chancefor sustained improvement. Most people in the market don't [considerit likely] that there is room for a sustained improvement in the longend for quite a while. There's at least a sense that people have towait to see whether or not this improvement in prices is sustained,and there's a lot of skepticism about that. Some people don't thinkthe progress has been all that it should have been. And then we havethese deficits. The market also frequently makes reference to theglobal demands for capital. Finally, our own statements may not beadequate, and there are all these political uncertainties. So, peopledon't seem to have a lot of high hopes for the long end of the marketdoing a lot better. It's really a question of [rates] moving back upif the Fed were to ease.MR. SYRON. I don't know what caused [a move of] 10 basispoints one way or the other but it was interesting to me that onreports of symmetric [language in the directive] the market backed up.MS. LOVETT. Right.MR. SYRON. And then they saw, if not a softening, a lack offirmness in the economy--not an enormous amount but a measurableamount.MS. LOVETT. Right, and I do think the fact that the recoverydoesn't look like it's rolling ahead has been a help for the long end.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions? If not, wouldsomebody like to move the ratification of the transactions since thelast meeting?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Move it.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. We now move to theChart Show: Messrs. Prell, Stockton, and Truman.MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We'll be referring tothe set of charts that you all have before you labeled "Material forStaff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee."MESSRS. PRELL, STOCKTON, and TRUMAN. [Statements--seeAppendix.]CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very much, gentlemen.Questions from any of the Committee members? Vice Chairman Corrigan.6/30-7/1/92VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. What is the potential growth rateimplied in Chart 17?MR. STOCKTON. Basically 2 percent throughout the forecasthorizon and 2.1 percent as time goes on. Obviously, beyond the nextthree years what potential output will be is certainly open to muchwider question. But the evidence in the last few years at least makesus reasonably comfortable with something in the 2 percent range.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What is your labor force participationrate projection?MR. STOCKTON. It would go up a few tenths over the period.MR. PRELL. This potential output assumption is basicallywhat we communicated in that report on potential output, with theadjustment that was needed because of the change in the 1987 base yearfor the output measures.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. So, essentially, what is built inhere is a modest further increase in the labor force participationrate. Even allowing for that and taking the potential growth rate at2 percent, what I find really surprising--bordering I guess onunbelievable--is that if you look at case 2 versus case 3, thecumulative difference in the real GDP growth rate is always 0.6 of apercent over the whole period. And the absolute difference, ofcourse, in the unemployment rate at the end of the period is only 0.5percent. That strikes me a little as magic.MR. STOCKTON. Well, part of the problem is that in the pricestability case there is a timing difficulty. It has to do with thelag [in] Okun's law relationship that relates real GDP tounemployment. In the stable inflation case, you can see we're easingup growth a lot at the very end of the simulation in order to try tolimit the potential overshooting. In effect, if you carry out theprice stability simulation a little further, the unemployment rate isgoing to be down to about the natural rate within a year from the endof that simulation. So, that limits the discrepancy around 1997. Thesimulations use the identical Okun's law relationship so that thereisn't any structural difference in those two simulations. But thereis in the quarterly model, with relatively long lags elsewhere for theunemployment [rate].CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions?MR.. PARRY. You talked a bit about the effect on inflationaryexpectations of our goals with regard to inflation. I wondered if youhad done some work or had a judgment about what some of the possibleadvantages might be of our being more explicit about our goals and howthat might affect inflationary expectations and therefore the actualtradeoff between growth and inflation that results from pursuing thoseobjectives.MR. STOCKTON. I certainly don't have any particularly wisdomto add on that point. We did a similar exercise a couple of years agofor the Committee and we talked a great deal about the role thatcredibility might play. I guess one could look at this currentepisode and, given the output losses we have already incurred to6/30-7/1/92achieve the disinflation that we have, feel that it's difficult to seein that any credibility effects so far. The costs seem pretty much[as expected]. If there were a dramatic break in the regime--in theway in which monetary policy was made--one certainly couldn't rule itout. And one cannot rule out the fact that credibility even infinancial markets and among wage and price setters may not come assmoothly as the models suggest. It could very well be that at somepoint in the next year and a half or two years there will be asignificant break in inflation expectations. But I suspect that theeffects on output costs and disinflation will have more to do withyour actions rather than your pronouncements.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We in the past have had various studiessuggesting that there was an inverse correlation between the degree ofprice stability and productivity. I assume that that's not embodiedin here; that [takes] a much longer time. So, to that extent onemight presume that there is some underestimation of the real grossdomestic product here at the lower price expectations levels.MR. STOCKTON. That's correct, Mr. Chairman. We've made noadjustments here in terms of our expectations for future potentialoutput or the effect of price stability itself. Our research suggeststhat to the extent that correlation is there, it occurs at very longtime intervals, probably perceptibly beyond the time interval thatwe're considering here.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Angell.MR. ANGELL. What would be the impact of following case 2versus case 3 on the saving rate and thereby the investment rate overthat period?MR. STOCKTON. Well, the feedback from that to actualpotential output would probably be very minimal within the time framethat we have here. It's certainly the case that in the pricestability example the short-run effects of pursuing that policy, whichwould require higher real interest rates for a period of time in orderto bring inflation down, would be adverse for capital equipmentinvestment. But over the longer term in none of these cases is thesort of natural rate of interest being influenced by the course ofmonetary policy within this time frame. Our estimates suggest thatbecause there is an interaction in the long run between inflationthrough the tax system that is adverse [to] investment, the benefitsto potential output growth over the long run would be positive frompursuing case 2 versus case 3. In the short run, though--for the timeperiod that we're considering here--it's not clear that we see that.It would be more [true] of a 10-year horizon.MR. ANGELL. So, the argument for case 2 really is that thebenefits would appear in the period from 1996 to maybe 2006, which Ithink everyone would admit is a very long time.MR. PRELL. When you do a present value calculation, [given]the distortions with a non-indexed tax system, the payoff doesn't lookbad for the short-term sacrifice. But it is a substantial sacrificein the short run.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor LaWare.6/30-7/1/92MR. LAWARE. I'm a little puzzled by the projected effect offood and energy prices. We've been seeing a lot in the press justrecently and also in the Beigebook about crop problems this year andcutbacks in beef and pork, and yet you forecast very modest increasesin food prices in the CPI this year and even next year. And on theenergy side we see increased imports and you seem to dismiss theeffect of that by not believing that OPEC and Saudi Arabia are goingto stick to a more restricted production capacity. Is that becauseyou see it being fully offset by Iraq returning to the market?MR. TRUMAN. On the OPEC side, there is a considerable debatein the market as to exactly what Saudi Arabia's position is. Therewas a runup when the market thought [the Saudis] were shifting theirposition, and then it backed down somewhat when uncertainty wasintroduced. We have predicated our forecast on the assumption thatthey haven't shifted their position on market share. That is becausethey have been increasing their productive capacity and it would seemto be a waste of money to increase productive capacity if they weren'tgoing to use it. And we have Iraq coming in three months later thanwe had before, so that's a negative factor. This forecast of a dropin oil prices from the current spot rate is essentially the same as inthe futures market. It is a bit more optimistic but the optimism ison the order of 50 or 75 cents a barrel. So, for better or worse,it's essentially consistent with the market forecast, which forobvious reasons is taking the same view, and that leads us to [aforecast of] a little more of a drop-back.MR. STOCKTON. On the agricultural side, it's obviously tooearly to tell yet how this year's crop production will turn out.Indeed, there has been a great deal of volatility in the markets inthe past month and a half. As you know, it looked as if the weatherwould be dry and then in the last few weeks the rains have come andthe situation has looked considerably better. We're not expecting tosee any serious disruptions in terms of crop production this year.But inventories are lean and if I had to say which side the risksmight be on I'd say that if we did see a shortfall, there could be apotential price spike. We're expecting meat production to pick backup this year and we think that is going to keep the lid on meat pricesas well. Basically, on the food price side, a really encouragingdevelopment was the significant break we saw last year. [Previously,food price increases] had been running in a reasonably high 5 to 5-1/2percent range. And a big chunk of that [break] is attributable to thenonvolatile components. It just looks as if underlying food priceinflation and probably wage developments as well have settled downconsiderably.MR. LAWARE. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Syron.MR. SYRON. Back to Chart 17: I want to ask a question onpotential, just in terms of gross orders of magnitude. If we were tofollow case 2 right now, say, and [the economy] were running belowcapacity in the interim, the question I have--and I think I know theanswer--is about the relative magnitude of the investment that isgiven up because of running below potential for a while and how thatinfluences potential in the out years even beyond [your forecasthorizon]. It's probably not great. There were other questions about6/30-7/1/92how these various approaches could affect potential. I was wonderingto what extent the foregone production and the share of productionthat would go into investment have been incorporated and what themagnitude of that would be.MR. STOCKTON. In terms of the price stability scenario andthe interest rate assumptions that go along with that, we would lookfor the level of business fixed investment through the end of '96,let's say, to be roughly 5 percent lower than in case 1, thedisinflation case, which is more of a middle ground type case. But Idon't think even in the longer term that that is a transitoryreduction in investment; we don't really see that having significantnegative effects for the overall rate of capital accumulation furtherdown the road. If anything, we think at some point that would turnaround and, because the tax distortions would be less, that we'dactually see better and more productive investment further out.MR. SYRON. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. On Chart 10, the household spending chart, whatkind of job growth lies behind the personal income and consumptiondynamics that you've laid out?MR. PRELL. Dave showed you some numbers for the householdemployment increase. Basically, we have payroll employment gainscreeping up toward a level of 150,000 per month by the end of theyear, which is really a very modest increase relative to the trend,say, in the last decade. And that's reflected in the very slowprogress that we see in the reduction of the unemployment rate.MR. BOEHNE. What do we have for the year to date roughly?MR. PRELL. Well, we've had only a very small increase intotal payroll employment. I'm not sure what it is. We're approaching1 million on the household series, I think.SPEAKER(?). Payroll [employment growth] has been more like300,000 so far, hasn't it?MR. PRELL. Payroll has gone up only about 300,000 fromDecember to May.MR. BOEHNE. So, even though it's modest growth, we stillhave to have a notable increase in the rate of job growth?MR. PRELL. Well, a little better than we have been doing.The last couple of months have been in the ballpark. We would expectto get some acceleration, but it's quite modest overall.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.MR. HOENIG. On Charts 5 and 6, just to make sure I heardwhat you said, is the projected improvement in our export figures duemore to the devaluation of the dollar than to the economic activity inthis country?6/30-7/1/92MR. TRUMAN. No, most of it is due to economic activity. Thedollar, although it has moved around and is at the low end of where ithas been, doesn't stay there. It may be wrong in the forecast per sebecause it has been up and down for the past year. What I meant tosay was that, in comparing the two halves of 1993, the relative[widening] of the gaps between the red and the blacks bars is afunction of the lower level of the dollar as a secondary effect thatplays out.MR. HOENIG. Okay, thanks.MR. PARRY. Related to that, do you have more conventionalassumptions about income elasticities of demand for imports?MR. TRUMAN. It's on the order of 1-1/2 percent, though wehave this level because we're picking up additional factors oncapacity utilization [unintelligible] and that pushes up the[unintelligible] end of the income elasticity on the import side.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. Back to that comment about inflation: I'm verysympathetic to the latter part of your presentation and your responsesto questions. I think this issue of the transition costs and how theyare related to the credibility of our commitment to price stabilitydeserves a lot of attention. That's a very difficult issue but a veryimportant one, and I think we need to keep reemphasizing it. But Ifound Chart 14 very disturbing. Whatever the model or theory we have[to explain] those kinds of relationships [as they may relate to]progress toward actively reducing inflation, it gives rise to theperception on the part of the public at large and political peoplethat credibility of that the commitment is tied to our ability towithstand political pressures, in other words the willingness to[unintelligible]. Credibility of the price stability commitment istied to tolerance of slack, a gap of actual output below potential, oran unemployment rate above the natural rate. So then it becomes acontest of political wills, which I don't think any of us believes isembodied in what we're doing. To tie together the progress towardreducing inflation to any kind of real magnitude [in] explaining whatmonetary policy has done or is doing shifts the nature of thediscussion, I think.MR. PRELL. Of course, this isn't a public discussion.MR. JORDAN. I understand.MR. PRELL. I would emphasize that basically we are lookingfrom various points of view here at the debate that one might haveabout the progress we'll make. This relationship has proven to bequite robust in the short run, though as Dave Stockton emphasized thisis not a fully specified model. We are not taking account ofexpectations effects, which are obviously very important in shiftingthe short-run Phillips curve around. But there is information in thisthat suggests that to a first approximation slack is what gives us thedisinflation force. And I think we need to confront that internallyin our policy decisions in terms of what tradeoffs are acceptable inthe short run, recognizing as Dave emphasized that over the long run-10-6/30-7/1/92the actions might build credibility and lower those costs and makethose short-run tradeoffs increasingly advantageous.MR. JORDAN. But even that response--saying that slack gives[impetus to disinflation]--may be based on a model that says theappearance of slack is information that people use in forming theirexpectations. I don't know how people form their expectations. Somepeople will cite budget deficits; some people will cite the past; somewill cite politics. But by saying that it has to do with slack orunemployment being above what is perceived to be an acceptable ratemay be simply something that helps people form their judgments aboutfuture inflation. But that again ties it back to a tolerance on thepart of this group to that slack or unemployment--and I find that verytroubling--rather than the more straightforward way of saying thatwhat we're talking about when we talk about inflation is thepurchasing power of money over time. And, therefore, one would talkabout it in terms of money growth.MR. SYRON. I thought this was just looking at the stylizedfacts. Have we had any period in modern history in which there wassubstantial progress in the fight against inflation without slack?MR. PRELL. Well, one can look at dramatic regime changes--major currency changes and so on--to see whether there were tradeoffsin those instances and try to find information there. I'm not surethe results are uniformly favorable. I appreciate your point,President Jordan, but from our perspective there has to be somemechanism that gets you from money to prices. And that mechanismhistorically seems to involve some constraint on aggregate demandexpansion, some weakening of demand for resources, some slack thatevolves, and then there is the wage and price response. One findsonly limited evidence--Dave has worked on this in the past--of a moredirect effect which may be consistent with a view that all wage andprice setters out there are watching the money stock trends andadjusting their expectations accordingly. But that isn't obvious; thestatistical evidence is limited to support that kind of directchannel. But if one could declare with absolute credibility thatinflation will end next week, then it would be costly for people tobehave in any other way. So the question does arise: What could onedo if one of those [unintelligible] was raised here to enhance thecredibility of that commitment. Of course, once you fail, then you'velost that--MR. JORDAN. Well, I don't disagree with the dynamics thatyou're describing, given the institutional context and the rest. I'mjust hesitant to explain to anyone that I think inflation will comedown because of the high unemployment rate.MR. PRELL. Well, we're always very attentive to thatpolitical problem in writing public statements. But some sense ofthat, I think, is abroad and it doesn't come as a very great shock topeople that that is the mechanism that many people have in mind.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions? If not, wouldsomebody like to start the discussion? Bob.MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, uncertainty about the direction ofthe Twelfth District economy has increased since the last meeting. It-11-6/30-7/1/92has become clear that many of the District's states that previouslyhad posted solid employment gains have weakened in 1992. The Districtas a whole has posted employment gains of only 0.1 percent betweenDecember 1991 and May of this year. All states except Oregon and Utahhave registered either little increase or actual declines inemployment since December. Since the beginning of the yearCalifornia's employment has stopped declining. However, employment is1.5 percent below the level of a year ago and downside risks clearlyremain. Northern California is following the national pattern, butsouthern California is exhibiting further weakness. Manufacturingcontinues to report job losses, and more declines in aerospace areexpected in the Los Angeles area. Moreover, addressing the statebudget deficit is likely to weaken the state's economy further.Current estimates suggest that the state has close to an $8.1 billiondeficit. Cuts of that magnitude would reduce next year's nominalstate and local spending below that of the fiscal year just ending.Failure to accomplish cuts by tomorrow will force the state to issuescrip. Negotiations have been deadlocked, particularly on cuts ineducation spending, which also is likely to see nominal spending belowthe current level.Finally, the agricultural sector is facing hard times.Drought conditions prevail in Idaho, Utah, and eastern Oregon, leadingto low yields and some acreage reductions as well as herd reductionsin the cattle industry. While drought conditions are not as severethis year in California, prices for many commodities, includingvegetables, cotton, and citrus, are down sharply from a year ago,leading to low profitably and some losses.Turning to the national economy, I believe that a moderateexpansion will continue throughout the remainder of this year and in1993. Although consumption data for May were disappointing and I'dsay somewhat worrisome, they were not too surprising in view of thevery rapid growth in consumer spending that we saw in the firstquarter. Overall, I wouldn't be surprised to see somewhat fastergrowth this year than is projected in the Greenbook, but thedifference certainly is well within the normal range of error. I alsowould agree with the Greenbook that underlying inflation is on a verygradual downward trend. However, it is surprising that we have notseen a more rapid decline in inflation, given the slow growth over thepast three years. And I believe it is possible that the Greenbook maybe a little on the pessimistic side. Perhaps a more explicitstatement of our inflation goal and our plans to achieve it mightdispel questions about our resolve and lead to improvement ininflation expectations. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Keehn.MR. KEEHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Starting first with acomment on the staff forecast: Our forecast is very similar to thestaff's in terms of the numbers; the pattern, though, is somewhatdifferent. Our GDP forecast for '93 is lower than the staff's and infact is lower than our forecast for this year. The differences seemto be in the auto and housing sectors. Our forecast for sales of carsand light trucks in the second half of next year is lower than thestaff forecast by about 500,000 units at an annual rate. Our outlookfor long-term interest rates also is not quite as optimistic as thestaff's and, as a result of that, our housing starts for next year-12-6/30-7/1/92also are lower than theirs. These two differences, of course, lead tosecondary differences at least in terms of growth. Our inflationforecast is very similar to the staff's; we're a little lower thisyear and about the same for next year. While the differences betweenthe forecasts aren't that great, assuming that this year and next yearwork out about in line with either of these forecasts, in my view thebigger question is whether there is enough momentum in the underlyingeconomy to be sustainable. After three years of comparatively weakgrowth, the likelihood of a fourth year of weak growth this year andperhaps a repeat next year for a fifth year of the same, [the questionis]: Is this the best we can do and will this growth be strong enoughto improve significantly the employment problem as well as theutilization of our industrial capacity? I have growing feelings thatit will not--that this is not a satisfactory forecast--and that in ourpolicy discussion we will need to take steps to try to develop somestronger growth.In terms of the region, while many of the major sectors ofthe District's economy have shown some improvement, here again thedurability as well as the strength are open to question. The majorarea of improvement has been in the auto manufacturing sector. Thesecond-quarter production schedules were somewhat over those of lastyear. Third-quarter schedules have been set preliminarily at levelsabout 17 percent higher than last year. But those schedules are basedon the expectation that retail sales will increase from currentlevels; and if they don't, then we would expect the productionschedules to be reduced. In turn, the suppliers to the auto industryhave seen some pickup in orders. In the steel business, for example,they expect to ship some 21 million tons in the third quarter, up from20 million tons in the second quarter. For the full year they areforecasting shipments of 82 million tons; that's not a bad year. Andthe improvement in the steel business is not just on the auto side;for example, shipments to appliance manufacturers are also a bithigher.Other parts of the District have been a bit mixed. Housingactivity was higher in May than in April, though April was quite weak,and transaction volume has been pretty good. However, retail sales,which increased in May, seem to be down in June; at least the reportsare that sales were a little on the soft side. Weather may have beena factor; it has been exceptionally cold in our part of the Midwestand people just are not buying the things that they normally do atthis time of the year.In the agricultural sector, we may be in for a difficultsummer. We had an exceptionally wet spring, which resulted in adifficult planting season. That was followed by an exceptionally dryspell and has affected much of the corn and soybean crops of theDistrict. And most recently we had frost conditions in Michigan andWisconsin, which have had an effect on the fruit crop. Despite that,it's still early enough that if we get a reasonable break on theweather from this point on we should get pretty good crop yields. Butgiven this uncertainty in the farm area, sales of agriculturalequipment have been very weak--surprisingly weak--and indeed weredescribed as terrible by one CEO. As an example, combine sales in Maywere some 80 percent under the volume sold last May. Therefore,production schedules, which had already been reduced, are now in theprocess of being cut further.-13-6/30-7/1/92On the employment front, District employment has increased byabout 100,000 since the low point in August of 1991, but despite thatincrease we still have recovered only about 25 percent of the lossesthat we sustained during the recession. Many manufacturers arecontinuing to implement staff reduction plans, and I just don't senseany fundamental improvement in the underlying employment conditions.Inflation continues to look constructive. Intensive competitiveconditions seem to be an absolute lid on significant price increases.The people I talk to say the pricing environment for all products isreally very tough. One major manufacturer, admittedly [with] anenormous amount of clout, is achieving a reduction of almost 1 percentin the cost of outside purchases this year. And I must say that intalking to people I just don't have any sense that inflation is a partof their current thinking. Net, while I think the District has shownimprovement since the last meeting, the strength of the underlyingmomentum and the vulnerability of this level of activity are the majorquestions. Thank you.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me start withthe District activity. As in the nation as a whole, the pace ofimprovement in the Sixth District that became evident in the firstquarter has tapered off. The District's economy is relativelydependent on housing activity in the nation as a whole, so thedownturn in housing activity--or moderation perhaps in the pace ofhome sales and building at the national level--has been very quicklyfelt in the District. Our most recent survey of manufacturing plantsalso reflected this; our respondents' outlooks were a bit lessoptimistic than the month before. At the same time it was still arelatively positive report. In general, a fairly broad-based butmoderate expansion seems to be taking hold in most areas of theDistrict with the exception of oil-dependent Louisiana and SouthFlorida. The situation in South Florida is linked to declines ininterest rates, as you would expect with the heavy retirementpopulation there. As for other areas, consumer spending appears to bemoving ahead, with nondurables, particularly apparel, continuing tosell quite well. Auto dealers are also showing some improvement.While the business contacts I have met with recently appearconfident that growth will be sustained, they're very clearlydisappointed with the pace of expansion and are looking for greatergrowth. At the same time, their comments don't indicate that a lackof liquidity or financing is a problem anymore. If anything, they'rereporting improved cash flows from lower interest rates, and severalhave noted that banks have become increasingly aggressive in effortsto make loans. Only a few of the people that I've talked to believethat a further easing of policy would provide much help or wouldgenerate the enthusiasm about the outlook that seems to be missing.Rather they think it's going to take a long time to work off theimbalances that developed during the 1980s. As others have said, inthe Sixth District we're not hearing any reports of price increases atall. So, while there has been some [moderation] in activity in theDistrict, I think it is still relatively good albeit quite modest.Now, with respect to the national outlook, we have some minordifferences with the Greenbook in the various components of GDP butour forecast is basically the same. We still have a substantial-14-6/30-7/1/92difference in the forecast of inflation, which we see as beingbasically unchanged through 1993. I guess I'm a little less confidentthan I was at the last meeting that the recovery has really takenhold, although I still think we're in a sustainable recovery. It maybe that this is the best we can do for the time being. It seems to methat we need to keep in mind that monetary policy can't raise theeconomy's potential, at least in the short run. So, in general, whileI think we're moving ahead with some falling back perhaps in the rateof growth, we need to measure our policy response very carefully.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Black.MR. BLACK. The big economic news in the Fifth District, as Isuspect many of you know, is that it may soon be possible to buy a BMWthat has a honk with a southern accent! BMW people have justannounced that they are going to build a huge new factory in northwestSouth Carolina that will create jobs for about 4,000 people. I wishthat had been announced before our last directors' meeting when youhad an exchange with our protectionist-minded Mr.Chairman, who has been mourning the loss of those high payingjobs and their replacement by this sort of thing. But there is anunfortunate side of this in that South Carolina paid about $150million in subsidies in order to get that factory. So, this is not apurely economic decision but it does augur well for that particularpart of the country at the expense of some other part. Now, beyondthat, not much really has changed in the region. Gradual recoveryseems to be continuing and business people are generally optimisticabout the near-term outlook pretty much across the spectrum of sectorsand industries. The tone of the anecdotal information, though, at ourlast joint meeting of our three boards was a little less positive thanit had been at the meetings immediately before that. Against thisbackground, we think the optimism about the future could fade prettyfast unless actual business activity does accelerate at least a littlein the fairly near-term future.At the national level, our projections are very close tothose of the staff. We expect slightly more real growth and slightlyless inflation, but the differences are not really significant. Thequestion of where the risk lies seems to me to depend largely on howmuch weight one wants to give to the persistent weakness in M2 as anindicator of what lies ahead. We're still inclined to discount mostof the recent weakness that we've seen because we feel most of itcomes from the portfolio adjustments that are reflecting thestructural changes in banking and financial markets with which all ofus are very familiar. But the longer this weakness persists, the moreuneasy it makes us. Our uneasiness was heightened by the excellentanalysis in the second part of the Feinman/Porter memorandum whichsuggested that M2 is by no means dead. So, on balance, we think therisk of error is now moderately on the down side rather than the otherway around, given this renewed contraction in M2 that apparently hasbeen taking place in June.Despite whatever questions there may be regarding the realside of the projections, we are very comfortable with the staff'sprojection that inflation will come down. This is also our projectionand in fact we expect somewhat more decline than the staff does boththis year and next. And we think there's a good possibility that a-15-6/30-7/1/92growing acceptance of this belief on the part of the public would workto bolster real economic activity.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. The District economy continues to expand slowlywith New Jersey the weakest of the three states. Manufacturing hasbeen the relative bright spot, although by no means robust. Retailinghas been flat to up slightly, reflecting in part the weather but alsojust the general weakness in the economy. The sense I have in thehousing area is that it has been slowing, but in the commercial realestate area there are people close to that market who feel that it hasreached bottom. Some of the deals are now attractive enough that someproperties may begin to move, although there's no real hard evidenceof that; that's just a sense. The major weakness in the District hasbeen in the job market. We've had a weak labor market now for manymonths. There is some hint of improvement perhaps in themanufacturing area, but overall there continue to be losses in jobs inthe District. At banks, consumer lending is up some but businesslending is still soft and I don't hear any of the talk about bankersbeing aggressive, at least from the point of view of the businesscommunity. All in all, I think the District continues to expand butprobably more slowly than the nation as a whole.What strikes me about the national economy is that almostwherever one looks the various sectors are either weak to begin withor, after some improvement for several months, are in the process ofslowing. That again puts the spotlight on sustainability. What we'recounting on for the Greenbook forecast is that out of this slow andslowing situation we're going to get enough job growth and generateenough income that it will feed enough consumption to keep a modestexpansion going during the second half of this year and then nextyear. I have more doubts about this sustainability than I did severalweeks ago. If growth in the early part of this recovery had been at 5or 6 percent or 4 to 5 percent or even 3-1/2 to 4 percent, I thinkthis slowing in momentum that we're experiencing would be welcomed.But the strongest quarter we've had is under 3 percent; and this issupposed to be the fastest part of the recovery, so there's not a lotof downside margin. If there were brighter prospects from exports orsomething stronger outside the immediate job/income/consumptiondynamics, I'd feel more confident about achieving this [projected]growth rate of 2-1/2 percent or so. But there just isn't much marginand we appear to be going into a period of some slowing. So, I thinkthe downside risk is greater than it was a few weeks ago. And whilemonetary policy should never depend on one particular indicator, itseems to me that the key area we need to look at with regard to thesustainability and dynamics [of this recovery] is job growth. If wedon't get even the modest kind of job growth that underlies thisGreenbook forecast, the expansion is going to break down. If we seesome signs of this job growth [expectation] not being met, then Ithink this expansion has some real problems and we will have to take aserious look at what our options are in the monetary policy process.I think we can largely discount what is happening to M2, butwhat bothers me is that M2 was growing slowly and now has turnednegative and it's in the context of total credit being very weak. Ifthe weakness in bank credit were being offset by credit from otherfinancial intermediaries, it would be easier just to forget the whole-16-6/30-7/1/92thing. But that's not happening. So, there are a lot of good reasonsfor discounting M2 but, putting it all together, one just has to havea nagging feeling that there is something here that is reflecting theunderlying demand in the economy.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our District continuesto grow very sluggishly in my opinion. We have seen some job growthin construction, particularly residential construction, over the lastyear. This is primarily in our northern area, in Omaha and in theDenver, Colorado area. Beyond that, agriculture is at best steady;we've seen some production loss in wheat because of the weather butthat is being helped a little by some firmer prices. So, we don'texpect a drop there but we're not seeing [that sector provide] anystrength to the economy, as it has in the past. Our manufacturingsector was very sluggish through the first quarter; while we have seensome improvement there anecdotally, it really has been very modest atbest. Others have talked about the auto industry; we've not seen anypickup in jobs in plants in our area, at least to this point. Ourenergy sector is, as it has been, very, very poor for a lot ofdifferent reasons, so it's not generating a lot of activity in ourregion of the country. So, we expect continued growth but at a rateless than we're seeing for the nation as a whole.As far as the national economy goes, we also are very closeto the Greenbook projection, which we would note was adjusted down inthe period going forward; that's consistent with our view. We see theeconomy growing very sluggishly and we're sensitive to that. That isconsistent with the type of credit activity we're seeing on loans andwhat is being reported to us. So, we think there is a downside riskto the economic recovery right now and, although we see improvement inthe inflation rate, we think that downside risk is something to bealert to as we go forward with the policy discussion.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, the economy of the EleventhDistrict, which did better than the U.S. average during the recessionand the first phase of the recovery, seems to have fallen back to theaverage of the U.S. recovery. Previous sources of strength havedissipated somewhat; activity is essentially flat now with employmentgrowth barely perceptible and certainly too slow to cut into theunemployment rate, which is about at the national average. There'sjust no sense of momentum in the District as far as I can tell.At the national level, we have no quarrel with the Greenbookalthough we believe that the risks are greater on the down side. Itappears that the strongest quarter of 1992 may already be behind us.The headwinds include: declining defense spending, which will begoing on for a long time; the overhang of real estate, which will bewith us a long, long time; the need and desire to reduce debt at alllevels in the economy; the fact that there is no room for fiscalstimulus; and now the recently diminished export prospects. All ofthese headwinds seem too strong for the stimulus of lower short-terminterest rates. It may even seem surprising that we have the strengthof the recovery that we do have in view of all these longer-termtrends. Our own staff's optimism about the sustainability of this-17-6/30-7/1/92second phase of the recovery seems to have waned somewhat lately.We're concerned about the slow growth of M2. While we have beendiscounting the measured M2 somewhat because of the special factorsthat we all know about, we're still concerned because even aftertaking those into account there appears to be some slowing in M2. Theproblem with all this is that I'm not sure there's anything we can doabout it. It seems to me that further easing moves at this point arejust as likely to raise long-term interest rates as to lower them.But I believe we ought to consider [a move] carefully. And if wethink a further slight easing of monetary policy might result in a cutin the prime rate, even if it did not result in a lower 30-year bondrate, since the prime rate-based lending is so important to the smallbusinesses and the entrepreneurs who are so essential for job creationat this point, we might want to consider it on that basis.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.MR. MELZER. In terms of the economic projections, we're anoutlier at the high end in both years on real GDP and the CPI. Idon't put a lot of credence in these projections in general in termsof how helpful they really are in the policymaking process. But evenif we were where the staff is, with a somewhat more modest projectedrecovery, I would actually be somewhat encouraged by that. I thinkthe monetary policies that we have pursued really have been quitedifferent than those pursued in and around other postwar recessions.And I think the fact that we're coming out of this recession with amuch more modest growth rate gives us the chance to make somesustainable progress on the price front. I would say in general thatthe pattern in the past was that monetary policy was much toostimulative in and immediately following recessions; and that has beenassociated with much higher rates of real growth than we're seeingnow. But that creates relatively soon, in a matter of several years,a fairly tricky [choice to] reverse course to keep things expanding.So, I'm actually not discouraged by what we're seeing here. In termsof what our fundamental job is, that may set up a unique opportunityfor us. The other thing, which is not something that I've heardaround this table but when I read it in the papers I cringe, is thisthought that the low measured inflation we're seeing right now somehowgives us room to do things. It may in a sense if we could performthis high wire act and figure out when to reverse [course] again. ButI really think the effect of our actions on inflation ought to bebased on what we see happening two or three years down the road andnot on the concept that low measured inflation right now gives usperceived room in somebody's mind to do something.As far as what we're seeing in the Eighth District, it's thesame pattern that I've been reporting. We continue to have job growththat's considerably in excess of what we're seeing nationally. Andthe pattern is still the same: We're seeing very modest declines onthe manufacturing side that are made up by fairly significant growthon the non-manufacturing side, generally across the board except inmining. There is particular strength in construction; residentialconstruction contracts remain very strong. We're seeing some slowingon the commercial side, which had also been very strong. Theanecdotal information that I'm hearing is consistent with continuingimprovement. I'm not picking up any ebullience but I haven't pickedup some of the negative vibrations that I've heard others report here.In terms of the anecdotal information, I see a pattern, for what it's-18-6/30-7/1/92worth, of an expansion that's continuing to take hold, with confidenceamong consumers and business people that is increasing and no warningsigns on that front.MR. BLACK. Tom, when you said you were an outlier oninflation did you mean on the low side?MR. MELZER. No, on the high side.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I personally agree inalmost every detail with the outlook presented in the Greenbook. Thepossible exception is the unemployment rate, which I think might be alittle slower to come [down] than is indicated in that forecast. Imust admit I'm a little surprised at some of the comments I've heardaround the table. It seems to me that we're getting pretty much whatwe expected for the first half of the year or maybe doing even alittle better. If I look back at the Humphrey-Hawkins numbers that weput together in February or just think about the Greenbook forecastover time, it seems to me that the numbers have come in pretty much asexpected. I don't see any really negative surprises in what hasunfolded. We were expecting a modest recovery and what we're gettingis along those lines. For what it's worth, we run an exercise inupdating our forecast with the latest evidence on the national economythat has become available since the last meeting, and we did it againthis time, of course. Our model, by the way, is purely statistical;there are no judgmental factors in it at all. The evidence that hasbecome available has looked rather mixed, but when we put it in themodel we got pretty much the same forecast that we had before thelatest data became available. So, I take it from at least that oneindicator that what we're getting is pretty consistent with what wethought we would get as we go along here.I might add, John, in regard to the question you raised aboutfood inflation: Talking to people in a couple of big companies in thefood wholesale and retailing business in Minneapolis recently, theysaid they think we're overestimating food inflation at the consumerand wholesale levels. We're going to be meeting with them further totry to understand what the difference is, but their view is that ithas been pretty tough to raise prices in that business as well. Wewill see if we can find out a little more about that.I would think that the risks, at least in terms of realgrowth, may be on the up side as much as on the down side at thisjuncture. I say that on the basis of the anecdotes that have come myway recently in the District. The obvious caveat, of course, is thatthe District is pretty thinly populated and may not have a big impacton national performance. Just to give you a formula for this:Tourism was at a record last year but all the tourist spots are wayahead of last year so far this year.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. It has been discovered by Canada!MR. STERN. I don't know; maybe we ought to secede and joinCanada!-19-6/30-7/1/92MR. BLACK. You have an awfully big sample in relation toyour universe! Let's look at it that way.MR. STERN. Highway construction has been strong; I take itthat is tied to the highway program that was put in place at thefederal level, but we're getting a number of reports along thoselines. Residential construction has been strong; auto dealers seemencouraged; and retail sales in general have been pretty positive.It's not that everything is positive. The military bases, especiallythe air bases in the District, are adversely affected by what is goingon there. And there is some expectation that the [influx of] Canadianshoppers, who have been streaming across the border for quite sometime now, may slow. In the past that kind of information would haveled to some sense of despair; but this time people seem to beshrugging it off as something they can deal with.As for M2, I think I'll await Don's wisdom on that subjectbefore I comment.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Syron.MR. SYRON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the First Districtwe have not had a great change since the last time we met. But Iwould have to say now that it's on the soft side of "mixed." Thereason for that characterization is that there is a lot of variancewithin the District. The only place we're seeing any significantbounce-back is inside [Interstate] 495 in the greater Boston area,where the economy does show some signs of strength with vacancy ratesstabilizing, commercial rents stabilizing, and residential pricesactually firming. But all of this is because M2 is behaving the wayit has! That's an exaggeration, but we're seeing enormous flows intomutual funds. I meet with people from the mutual funds fairlyfrequently and they actually are at the point where they are concernednow and are sending warnings, if I can characterize it that way, topeople who are investing in junk bond funds. They have had justenormous flows--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You're saying that M2 has an inversecorrelation with the [inflows to mutual funds]?MR. SYRON. That's right, because of the importance of themanagement of funds and institutions [whose assets] don't count in M2and their being a big part of the greater Boston economy.MR. LAWARE. Boston strives to be different!SPEAKER(?). As the non-M2 economy!MR. SYRON. That's right, the non-M2 economy. See, that'swhy we've always been heretical! But there really is a concern abouta potential break [soon] in the equity market and also further out inthe junk markets. There's a lot of worry about how sophisticated manypeople are who are reaching for yield coming into this market. On amore serious note, once you get outside the greater Boston area, theperiphery--my notes here say "the periphery"--is poor. And that, ofcourse, is tied in large measure to what is happening in themanufacturing sector. We're not benefiting for reasons that don'thave anything to do with the national economy and the improvement with-20-6/30-7/1/92computers. It has to do with the problems in the high-tech industrygenerally in New England, though we are suffering from the pull-downin defense. I think we're just in a long and inevitable period ofreadjustment here that's going to be painful. Looking sector bysector: Retailers, excluding autos, report a somewhat weakersituation; housing is slightly weaker compared to the last time exceptat the low end of the market; and manufacturers, particularly of non-computer high-tech products, have seen some fall-off in their foreignsales but some slight improvement domestically. As for capitalspending plans, the only reason anyone we talk to is investing is notto increase capacity but because they have the notion that they haveto do it to remain competitive in a tougher world. The pricesituation is very similar to what we have heard elsewhere, with lotsof pressures on margins and prices looking quite good. Bank lendingis still quite slow and, given the amount of capital that has beenraised by many institutions, I think it's less because of supplyconstraints and more generally because of the [slow]down in demand.[Unintelligible] anecdote, we find that these things always seem totake a year and a half: This week the Rhode Island crisis wasresolved a year and a half after it started--at some substantial costto the state, as is always the case.As far as the national economy goes, we're in generalagreement with the Greenbook. However--and this isn't a comment onthe Greenbook so much--in going through the exercise myself for aHumphrey-Hawkins forecast this time I noted that at least in my ownforecast, and I think this has been true generally, the centraltendency for the last four years has been for serial optimism in ourforecasts for economic growth and, with the exception of one year,serial pessimism on inflation. I'm not saying that that's going tocontinue going forward, but I think it is instructive that we havegenerally been too optimistic on the economy and too pessimistic aboutthe price side. In my own view I'm nervous about a lack of firming orcumulative [improvement] in the economy and how this will foldtogether. We're not seeing a firming, and a great deal of newsoftness is emerging. On that score, the numbers that we've beengetting on unfilled orders now for three quarters of the year become aconcern. One starts to ask: What is the dynamic for this to cometogether? We keep talking about confidence, but unless we see someimprovement in income, we have to start to wonder how sales are goingto keep going. And as for the improvement we've seen in income sofar, even with the most recent figures income is not growing as muchas retail sales and an awful lot of that income is in transferpayments. If we look at what has come from employment in the profitsector, we don't see anything there that is consistent with animprovement in confidence. All things put together, we would expect asomewhat higher unemployment rate than the staff, but marginally so,based on about the same outlook for GDP. We think the staff forecastis pretty evenly weighted; however, I'm concerned that the cost of amistake is not evenly weighted but [is greater] on the down side. Myview may be formed too much on the basis of conversations with peoplewho are worried about continuing financial fragility and what willhappen if there's too much disappointment in the marketplace.I'll make one final comment on this: As far as the Ms go,despite the inverse beneficial impact in Boston, we've always beenrather skeptical of the Ms. But I do think they say something. Justlooking back over the last decade, unless we get a break back up in M2-21-6/30-7/1/92we will be further outside the M2 and M3 target ranges than we've beenin the last ten years in an environment in which we would have to saythat, at least thus far, we've been disappointed with the economicperformance we've seen. I think that puts us in a potentiallydifficult position in explaining our actions as we go forward.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Angell.MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that we ought to assume that theeconomy is really moving along at about a 2 percent growth path in thefirst half. I tend to discount somewhat that little higher number forthe first quarter, and I wouldn't consider moving back to 2 percent inthe second quarter and maybe only a little higher than that in thethird quarter as being out of line. It seems to me that it's verydifficult to derail and change the direction of an economy. We have ahuge transfer payments support network in this economy, and I justdon't see what it is that's going to turn all this around. We'reseeing a lot of the same things we've been seeing for some time but Idon't see new sources of weakness out there at this time. Whereas myforecasts for real GDP and the CPI are identical to the staff's for1992, I have some concern about the particular mix that the staff usesto get there. And it seems to me there's a vulnerability. I thinkthis adjustment period we've been in is really an adjustment period inregard to the personal saving rate in our economy. I expect thepersonal saving rate to be inching up whereas the staff has it prettyflat. I also see the trade deficit moving south again as avulnerability for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. And withthe dollar as weak as it is, any move at this point that would beassociated with a lower fed funds rate could quite easily beinterpreted as Federal Reserve acquiescence to a depreciating ordevalued dollar. And I'm not sure how world capital markets wouldreact to such an event. There's a real potential for upset in thatregard. Corporate profits and cash flows look pretty good, so thesaving rate in the business sector may be much better than in thegovernment sector, which doesn't look like it's going to respond veryrapidly and yet does, I think, provide a considerable amount ofrestraint.So, it seems to me that we're in a circumstance in which ourbeing seen as focusing on price level stability has more payoff thanany other action in terms of having faster growth. I just do not seehow an alteration of the present fed funds rate is going to contributeto an improved outlook, and I think it could very well contribute toinstability rather than stability.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. First, I have some comments from a Districtperspective. Traveling around the Fourth District and gettingacquainted with bankers and business people all over the area, I'mmost often meeting people for the first time. It's been very helpful,very instructive. In manufacturing, which is very important in theDistrict, the general sense is that things are improving modestly.The headlines will be something like "British Petroleum lays off 300."That's front page news. But Ford Motor Company recalling 800 orplanning to add another 800 doesn't make the news; or Goodyear,Reliance Electric, or Piedmont Corporation adding workers, if it showsup at all, is back on the third or fourth page or buried well inside-22-6/30-7/1/92the paper. When I talk to business people about their own views theytend to convey a sense of "well, we're doing a little better but we'reworried about the national economy." And they're worried about thenational economy either because of the budget deficit or because ofnational politics and concern about what kind of leadership we have,believing that the long-run outlook for the economy depends very muchon political leadership rather than institutional factors. But theydo not reconcile in a way that's clear to me what they are seeing orfeeling as they personalize their own businesses with what they thinkabout the economy at large. The retailers comment about how slowsales have been and usually attribute that to weather, which carrieswith it, of course, the expectation that sales are going to pick upwith better weather. So they could easily be disappointed if betterweather comes and they don't see sales and order books picking up.When I quiz people about their inflation outlook,consistently manufacturers and retailers say that it's not a questionof inflation, it's a question of deflation. They ask: How do wemanage stable prices or a decline in prices? But they think that thenational inflation rate is going to be 4 or 5 percent. Very rarely doI find somebody who is talking about something less than 4 percentover a 5- to 10-year horizon, even though in their own businesses theydon't expect to be able to increase prices. So there is a disparity[between] what they face or feel they are contending with and thisnational [view]. When I ask why they don't believe us about going toprice stability and what that world would be like in terms of interestrates and other things, they often cite the budget deficit or nationalpolitics or [what they see as] the outlook for easy money-- that sortof thing. There is no real substance to why they feel that way.A few other comments on sectoral developments: We see strongincreases in bookings at hotels throughout the District; theconvention business in the Fourth District is really doing quite well,maybe in part because it didn't have a boom so it didn't have a bustand kind of moved right through this. When I try to elicit sympathyfor how tough things are in southern California where I'm from, I getno sympathy at all. They think it's well deserved! [Laughter] Therehave been reports of a pickup in residential activity throughout theDistrict; we're seeing some new home starts pretty well throughout thewhole area. One banker reported commercial lending up 12 percentyear-over-year; he happens to be in an area where Ford Motor Companyis recalling workers and adding workers. That's balanced off againstbankers in the more agricultural areas expressing concern about athird year of drought; [they say] they're going to be getting a lot ofkeys if we do have a third year of drought. But they have carried[the farmers] this long; they need rain and there's nothing they cando about that.When I talk to bankers about interest rates and inflation,consistently without exception they talk about higher interest ratesand higher inflation. I asked them why we don't see more growth intime certificates of deposits. They say it's because their customersare waiting for higher rates and don't want to get locked in. Why arethey waiting for higher rates? [They reply that] when we get thehigher inflation, we're going to get higher interest rates. And Iasked them why they don't tell their customers that that is not goingto happen. They say because it is going to happen; we are going toget higher interest rates because we'll get higher inflation as soon-23-6/30-7/1/92as we get [more economic] growth. I've asked them to consider a worldin which we have roughly stable inflation and what that means and whatthey're going to pay on their checkable deposits and their regularsavings--what it was like, say, in the early 1960s. And they simplysay they don't believe it [will happen]; they're not willing to lowercheckable rates or regular savings rates and make their customers,especially their older generation customers, unhappy because they willjust have to raise them again as soon as growth picks up or as soon asinflation picks up.Turning to the national economy, I don't disagreesignificantly with the Greenbook. I guess I would be a little moreoptimistic on real growth--on the higher end of the [Committeemembers'] range--but not any different at all, really, on theinflation outlook for the near term. The comment that Mike made aboutcapital goods was consistent with what I heard throughout theDistrict; I heard the same kind of phrase about the pickup in capitalgoods being far from spectacular. Most of our capital goods supplierssay they are getting more orders; the transplant plants especially arepicking up business from the foreign producers and taking backdomestic markets. But they all would characterize it as "notspectacular growth."CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Mullins.MR. MULLINS. Well, I don't have much to say this time soI'll probably talk longer than usual! For me there is an issue ofrisk which has intensified since the last meeting. There's noquestion about the point that Gary Stern raised: When you look at ourforecasts, they look better than last time or roughly in line. Forthe first quarter we expected growth to be around zero and it was 2.7percent; at least, I think it's settled on 2.7 percent now. Theconcern is about the pattern, obviously--the pattern of a surge earlyin the year followed by deterioration on the spending side--and thatraises questions about sustainability. Housing has clearly lostmomentum and there's also concern about retail sales. Auto sales haveheld up, but I wonder if that's not due to the age of the fleet andsome replacement demand or quality effects of American autos. Exportgrowth also has slowed and we do have industrial production coming in[slightly higher] now. As Ed Boehne pointed out, the key is whetherthat feeds in through job growth to stabilize the situation. We'renow projecting a couple of quarters of growth of around 2 percent.There's some question in my mind of a stalling here. Given thespending outlook, I think the chances are perhaps 1 in 3 that we'llhave a couple of quarters of growth below 2 percent and that indeedthe unemployment rate, instead of stalling, might well move up toward8 percent with a couple of quarters below 2 percent. I think thereare risks here.There are risks to the institution. I wonder how good a jobwe've done in selling our goal of price stability, and I wonder howwidely shared it is within the body politic and the American public.And I would just as soon not test that too strongly in the currentenvironment. I think there are risks also of instability and damageto our long-term objective. If we don't make a move and indeed we doget some bad news, I think we'll feel compelled to take moreaggressive actions down the road. The hallmark of the success of theprice stability program has been gradualism, and there might be-24-6/30-7/1/92concern about instability. On the other side, I see the upside riskas 4 percent growth; and with this degree of slack in the economy, Idon't think the consequences for inflation are all that troubling. Ido think there are businesses out there that would be relieved of thevise of several years of really tough demand considerations and whomight try to increase prices. So, I wouldn't entirely discount someinflation consequences. It does seem to me, though, that compared tolast time the downside risks have increased.It's less clear to me how we should respond. There's noquestion that the problems of the economy have not been caused bymonetary policy, and it's not clear how much monetary policy can do tohelp at this stage. But we are facing weak money and I'm afraidincreasing signs of weakness in the real economy. And as the centralbank most people view us as responsible for money growth. M2 iscertainly distorted; but, as has been pointed out, the debt aggregatesare also weak and even M1 has started to decelerate. Even with thedistorted M2, I can't help but suspect that the dramatic collapse wehad a few months ago contained some information about what washappening to consumer demand. I guess we'll talk more about thistomorrow.Of course, we could say that ease would have no effect; Ithink that's a tougher case to sell after the ease late last year andthe surge in spending. Our staff would call that Grainger causation;others might call it coincidence. [Laughter] But I think the economywas poised for that response in the sense that [our easing actions]from October through December unleashed refinancings and put spendablecash in people's pockets and helped with that spending spree.Moreover, I think [further easing now] would result in a reduction inthe prime rate and would increase cash flows. I doubt that it wouldunleash a wave of new borrowing. Governor LaWare's alma mater,Chemical Bank, reduced its prime a bit for a while and stood preparedto be trampled by credit-starved borrowers, and I think we can inferthat it was lonely out there. I do think [an easing action] wouldhelp on the cash flow side. We could say there are inflation riskswith easing. I think we're pretty much on record as saying that thepressures on inflation are easing, and I doubt that there's a strongcase that we'd do much to reverse them; the fundamentals are well inplace. But, again, it's not without cost. There is concern about thelong rate. Consistently as information has come out which increasesthe probability of ease, that long rate has moved down and vice versa.That doesn't mean, though, that actual ease would not result in thelong rate going up because then the critics actually would come out ofthe woodwork and start talking. But empirically I wonder about thatargument. So, I guess I see zero M2 growth in the context of buildingevidence of decelerating spending and that makes me nervous. It'shard for me to believe that this economy is money starved.Nonetheless, the liquidity is really hanging it back. We've had somehelp already: some effective ease from a dollar that is down 8percent from its peak in March; a long bond rate that is down 25 basispoints since March; and a mortgage rate that is down 50 basis pointssince March. Moreover, late last summer I thought real short rateswere a bit high. I think that's no longer the case. The [federalfunds] rate has come down 200 basis points since last summer; marketrates are low in real terms at about 0 to 1/2 percent. Bank ratesstill remain high in real terms, it seems to me, and a move may helpthere.-25-6/30-7/1/92I'm also mindful of the need to save a little ammunition foradverse contingencies. In my view we have very little left in ourarsenal with which to face an equity market packed with former bank CDinvestors who didn't like 3 percent returns; they'll be receivingtheir second-quarter mutual fund statements shortly showing a negative3 percent return. We may have a better test of the wealth effects ofmarket crashes out of this one. Indeed, I think the equity funds inthe last couple of months have shown net outflows for the first time.It also may be wise to save a little fire power considering theprospect of a hung presidential election and three months ofuncertainty on the impact on the stock market. And of course in thatevent the dollar may well fall out of bed, which may hurt our abilityto respond. So, overall, the situation is pretty complex and I amconcerned as every day passes that the chances increase that we'regoing to have to face another mini-dip. It seems to me the argumentfor considering a move is that it would do some substantive good, dorelatively little harm, and would show responsiveness to economicrisk. There are also arguments for holding tight and there are risksassociated with that. To a certain extent a lot of [the problem] isillustrated by the colloquy that Jerry Jordan had with Mike Prell onthis troubling sense in which price stability is linked, rightly orwrongly, to the tolerance for unemployment or bad economiccircumstances. I think Mike is correct: This view is abroad in theland or at least in the local vicinity. [Laughter] And if we holdtight, I think we should feel pretty comfortable about weathering theadverse outcomes that could occur, which include a couple of quartersof growth below 2 percent and the possibility of a higher unemploymentrate. I think we should go into that with our eyes open, willing toabsorb these outcomes without having responded to developing signs ofdeceleration. We certainly can't do anything about the secondquarter; we have little time left--six and one-half hours! [Laughter]We would I guess be expected to show responsiveness to the patterns ofweakness that have been developing and we could take out a littleinsurance on the third quarter. We could wait and try to respondlater. My view is that we're running out of time here and in thisenvironment it only gets tougher to act. Maybe I'm too pessimistic;the odds are still favorable that we're going to scrape by thissituation. But in golfing terms, I think it's a pretty tough lie;we're not in the sand trap and we're certainly not in the lake, but wemay be in the rough looking at a possible "bogey" as they say.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's not too bad.SPEAKER(?). If it's a bogey, I'll settle for that any day.SPEAKER(?). Or a double bogey.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor LaWare.MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, although I have read all the memosand listened to the various theories expounded, I don't claim tounderstand the refusal of M2 to respond to an established pattern ofstimuli. It's as though Pavlov's dog had his saliva glands dry up![Laughter]CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's a triple bogey!-26-6/30-7/1/92MR. LAWARE. And no matter how loud and long Pavlov rang hisbell the dog wouldn't drool. Something has to be different. Ibelieve it is an unprecedented conjunction of discomfiture on the partof bankers, consumers, and businessmen. Businesses won't borrow forinventory because they lack rapidly growing sales; and they arereluctant to borrow at current rates for plant expansion or equipmentreplacement because they can't discern what the future holds.Besides, they're still paying off the economically unproductive debtthey undertook in the '80s for buy-outs and takeovers. Consumers areintimidated by unemployment statistics--daily reports of corporatelayoffs not only of white collar and blue collar workers but of topexecutives--and the still formidable task of paying off the debt thatthey incurred in the '80s. Bankers who have been badly savaged byexaminers are just beginning to realize how much worse it's going tobe under the wonderful FDIC Improvement Act. The very fact that theyhave not moved the prime as a pricing strategy to attract loansindicates a reluctance to lend at all, even to the best risks. And,of course, demand for credit is anemic. Add to all of that theprevailing public impression that the nation is adrift with no clearsense of direction and one can understand this discomfiture.If these conclusions are accurate, then it is hard for me tosee what effect we could expect to have from a further easing ofpolicy. To the contrary, in my view there are some recognizablerisks, including a further weakening of the dollar, higher long-termrates based on the conviction that further ease is inflationary, andfinally the concern that we are pursuing a political course followingpublic jawboning from the Administration. M2 has not responded to ourprevious moves and it is hard to reason that it will suddenly comeback to heel. I think we need more time to see where [the economy is]headed before we make a policy move. And I don't see that the threatof immediate collapse is real enough to justify a tilt toward ease atthis time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I thought that was an eagle, myself!Governor Kelley.MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, my comments might follow prettyclosely along the lines set by Governor Mullins and Governor LaWare.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, wait a second. If you canreconcile [those two sets of comments], that's a double eagle!MR. KELLEY. Well, I think I came out understanding whereGovernor LaWare is but I'm not sure I came out understanding whereGovernor Mullins is, at least at this moment. At any rate, we've hadour usual extensive and excellent economic analyses and it seems thatwe probably have a recovery pretty firmly in place. But it's a frailchild and there's certainly some risk that it could falter. Policysetting would be a whole lot easier if things were either better orworse. If [the economy] were recovering smartly, we'd pretty wellknow what to do; or if it were faltering badly, we'd probably knowwhat we should do. But we're in a broad gray zone here where we havea slow, tentative, stop-and-start situation that is hard to read.That leads me to ask myself three questions, which I can share withyou. If that's where we are--in the slow, tentative gray zone--thefirst question is: What is appropriate for the central bank to try todo about it? Secondly, if we do wish to try to solidify [the-27-6/30-7/1/92recovery] or accelerate it, what is the best way to do that? Andthirdly, whatever policy we put in place, what are its likely long-term effects?On the first question of what is appropriate, I think thisCommittee and the central bank have several responsibilities. Themost basic one, a view I think we probably all share, is to foster andmaintain the integrity of the financial system and its currency.Then, of course, if the nation ever got into a crisis--a world war orsomething like that--we would have to do whatever it was necessary todo, no matter what, under circumstances like that. I think we alsohave a responsibility to try to ensure that we don't strangle theeconomy for lack of money and achieve price level stability byrendering the economy comatose. We could probably do that, but that'sobviously not desirable. So, if we do have a slow economy right now,I think we ought to ask ourselves if it is because we've followed aninappropriately tight money policy. And it seems to me that theanswer to that is fairly clearly "no." There is plenty of liquidityin the system. We've all talked a lot about loan demand and so forth;it just seems pretty obvious to me that the sluggishness we're dealingwith does not have its origin in overly tight monetary policy. So, weprobably are meeting our responsibilities there, at least so far andin the short run. Beyond that, it gets pretty murky as to what isappropriate for the central bank to try to do. The conclusion that Icome to on my first question is that we're not in a situation thatforces the central bank to put at risk its basic responsibility to thefinancial system of maintaining its integrity. Surely, we want to dowhat is appropriate to help the economy in any way that we can. But Ithink it's important that we do that without unduly running a risk toour primary responsibility.Turning to the second question: If we do decide that we wantto try to do something to accelerate the expansion through monetarypolicy, what is the best way to do it? If we ease policy, we do thatagainst the background of all this financial restructuring that isgoing on, which we all understand and have talked about a lot. Ithink it's critically important that it work its way through. If wedo ease policy, clearly we would probably get a lower prime rate; butI'm not at all clear that that would help loan demand or make verymuch of a difference, given this other [situation]. Would it be a bigboost to the monetary aggregates? I haven't seen any suggestion thatthat might happen. And it's very possible that it might becounterproductive in the sense that it could drive up long-term rates.If it did, it seems to me very likely that that would more than offsetany beneficial effects we might get. So, the conclusion I come to onthat question is that the chances are at least 50/50 that the best wayto help this economy, if our number one wish is to help the economy,is to stand pat.On the third question of what are the likely long-termeffects of any policy either way: If we stand pat and don't change, Iagree that it is certainly not riskless, as has been pointed out here.But I think the rewards that we could reap if we did stand pat and itworked out are very substantial indeed. If we ease now, I see severalrisks that could ensue from that. A couple of them have a pretty lowprobability; the third may have a little higher probability. The lowbut I think non-zero probability is that we could set up [conditions]for an inflationary surge down the road. If we were to ease and-28-6/30-7/1/92should that cause a very severe deterioration in the value of thedollar and possibly unleash an incipient credit explosion, that couldrequire a monetary policy response that would be destabilizing downthe road. That could cause some fairly radical kinds of upset to theprocess over time. Maybe a little higher probability would be that wewould succeed in what we wanted to do in accelerating the economy andin the process abort this restructuring process before it has a chanceto work its way all the way through. That would be very unfortunatein the sense that it would almost surely set [the stage for] a renewedweakness in the economy very shortly and it could possibly get us intoa new downturn prematurely. Perhaps a higher probability and aconcern that I have would be in the area of Federal Reservecredibility. Our credibility may be on the line right here. We coulddo ourselves some serious long-term damage if we were to ease and if,however inaccurately, the market perceived that we were pandering topolitics or that we were putting a premium on growth at any cost evenif we had to accept a devaluation of the currency and the financialsystem to get it. That could be very unfortunate. I think we mightbe in a very important time right now in terms of testing ourcredibility. If it's very clear that the wheels are coming off theeconomy and that things are going south, then I think we probablywould have to ease and the markets would understand that and would notfault us for it long term. But if an easing is seen as some kind ofpanic or a response to political pressure or what people wouldperceive as mistaken priorities, then I think our credibility wouldhave had it for a long time. And that would make our job down theroad much, much tougher. If we're able to stand our ground here andthe economy struggles on through, which seems to me to be the mostlikely possibility, that could be a very, very major boost to ourcredibility and pay us huge dividends over time. So, on balance, Mr.Chairman, I come down for now, subject to how events unfold, sayingthat standing pat is our best bet to help the economy short term andlong term.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Let me just start with the nationaloutlook in terms of the forecast. The forecast that the gentlemen andladies in New York put together this time is virtually identical toMike's forecast, not just in terms of the totals but even thecomponents. As a matter of fact, you could put a postage stamp on thetwo of them and cover them both in all the details. From my point ofview, given all the structural problems that people have been talkingabout, if the results over the next six quarters through the end of1993 were in line with those forecasts, I'd be a very happy fellow. Iwould also point out that in Mike's forecast the cumulative growthrate in real GNP for the years 1992 and 1993 combined is to thedecimal point equal to the 2-year growth rate in the price stabilityscenario in Chart 17. So, there's no conflict whatsoever [between]the forecast, if you want to believe that chart to that level ofdetail, and this notion of price stability.But the question, of course, is: How does one feel aboutachieving that result? I have to say that I share the views that havebeen expressed by a number of members in that I am uneasy aboutachieving that result. The point has been made at least by a numberof people that the problem is this sustainability question and thelack of any clear momentum in the economy; there's a sense [that the-29-6/30-7/1/92recovery] just doesn't want to take hold. The anecdotal comments thatI get from businesses, small and large, are virtually withoutexception consistent with that concern about sustainability, momentum,etc.; it's a lot like Ed Boehne's characterization of the situation.Now, the one thing that we do hear anecdotally that is different, evenfrom small businesses, is that the banks are out beating the busheslooking for business. And this is the first time we've heard that onany kind of systematic basis. But even where they're looking forbusiness, it isn't there. However, they do tell us now of callingofficers back on the road and of banks running seminars in variousparts of the state, and that's a change, clearly.In terms of where we go from here, Ed Boehne put his fingeron it as far as I'm concerned: The crucial variable in terms ofhitting something close to that forecast is the employment/income sideof the equation in a context where, Wayne, we at least don't have thesaving rate going down. At the beginning of the year one couldroughly visualize income streams compatible with that forecast withrather modest growth in employment--65,000 to 75,000 a month--throughout the year. But we've lost ground relative to that. To besure, some of it has been made up in income terms by [increased]hours, but the fact of the matter is that employment in Q1 was lowerthan in Q4 of last year and, if I have this roughly right--again usingMike's forecast--Q2 payroll employment in the forecast is somethinglike 400,000 higher than Q1. Obviously, it's going to take a prettyhealthy increase [in June] to get anything like that. The questionreally in some ways does come down to: Will the employment growth andincome growth be there that can produce enough by way of spending,given the structural problems, to get an outcome that roughlyresembles the forecast?On M2, I've never worried too much about it, but I think wecan explain a lot of that [weakness]. But, again, the point has beenmade by a couple of people that it's not just M2. If we look at thebroadest measures of credit, we still find this systematic weakness.We can explain a lot of that away, too, by the debt restructuring andthe necessary consequences of all the problems in the 1980s. But ifthat continuing pattern of very sluggish growth in any M out to M27continues in a context in which the economy begins to fall short ofthe forecast, it's going to be pretty hard for anybody to dance tothat tune.Again, I don't think the question in any sense is: Should webe trying to accelerate the economy relative to something like the[staff's] forecast? As I said, I'd be as happy as a clam if we got aresult that was even roughly like that forecast. But I come back toSi Keehn's comment a long time ago--3-1/2 hours ago or something likethat: What if it turns out that instead of looking at a 2-1/2 percenteconomy we find ourselves looking at a 1-1/2 percent economy? And interms of this argument about Fed credibility, which I think cuts bothways, if it turns out that we have a 1-1/2 percent economy and that'swhat we're responding to, then there's going to be a big problem interms of Fed credibility on the other side.This is as difficult a policy setting as I can remember in along, long time. I think Mike Kelley had it right: It would be aheck of a lot easier if the economy were either a lot better or a lotworse. But I do think the crucial question is not whether to seek an-30-6/30-7/1/92acceleration of the economy relative to the forecast but where one'scomfort zone is as to whether we can either hit the forecast or comewithin striking distance of it. And I'd have to say that my degree ofcomfort in terms of our ability to hit the forecast has waned fromwhere it was a couple of months ago. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, as a point of clarification, sothat people know on Thursday [when the employment data are released]what the surprise is relative to our forecast, I think the ViceChairman had the disadvantage of looking at some rounded quarterlyaverage numbers. Actually, what we have for June is only an 80,000increase in payroll employment.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. For June?MR. PRELL. Right.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I was talking about the quarterlyaverage.MR. PRELL. The quarterly average is 400,000 above the first-quarter average.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Lindsey.MR. LINDSEY. What I'd like to do is to summarize brieflywhat I think I have learned since our last meeting in May. It issummed up well in the aggregate; that is, I think the staff have verywell assimilated all the data that came out into their forecast.While quantitatively the forecast reflects some modest weakening, westill have a 2 percent quarter projected for the second quarter andsome minor downward revisions in the future. Those downward revisionsanticipate that real GDP at the end of the second quarter next yearwill be about $14-1/2 billion lower than [projected previously]. AndI think that's a fairly good summation of how much weakening we'veseen. Although I call that a modest quantitative weakening, I'msomewhat concerned about the qualitative weakening that lies behindthe numbers. Personal consumption expenditures will be about $20billion lower. Contrast that with a rise in inventories of $12billion. I think what we've seen is a more modest quantitativereduction that masks a substantial qualitative weakening in theeconomy. Much of the growth that is there is moving away from finaldemand and is moving toward business accumulation of inventories andfaster business investment. That very well may come to pass, but weare gambling, I think, on a riskier scenario. Inventories andinvestment are necessarily riskier components of demand than issomething like consumption. Quantitatively, that involves somethinglike 170,000 fewer houses, 13 percent less, and payroll employmentthat's about 650,000 less or about 0.6 of a percent of the work force.So, that's the magnitude. And I think it sums up well the amount ofweakening we've seen in the economy since the last forecast. I'd alsopoint out that the anecdotal information we have gathered here todaysuggests that the quarter has ended on a weaker note than it began.We were all somewhat more sanguine about the economic forecast at thelast meeting than we are now, and the anecdotal evidence from aroundthe country suggests that in fact the economy is weakening in Junerelative to what it was earlier.-31-6/30-7/1/92The second set of data that we've learned is that we've hadtwo tests of market reaction to what I would call basically "monetarypolicy developments." The first came immediately after the last FOMCmeeting on May 19 with the publication in The Wall Street Journal ofthe Wessel piece which described our reaction as having been one ofgoing toward symmetry. At the close on May 21, the 1-year note was up25 basis points, the 3-year note was up 30 basis points, the 10-yearnote was up 19 basis points, and the 30-year bond was up 9 basispoints on the publication of the Wessel story. That is one test--andI admit no test is perfect--of how the market responded to ourpresumed decision to go with a symmetric directive rather than theasymmetric directive that preceded it. The other economic test camelast Wednesday when the President had his interview with The New YorkTimes and the paper published what is obviously rather public pressureon us to [ease]. The 1-year rate fell 11 basis points, the 3-yearrate fell 11 basis points, the 10-year 5 basis points, and the 30-year2 basis points. So, I think that gives us some idea of the likelymarket reaction to what we might do. Those are the two economicthings I think we've learned.The political lesson we've learned is one that I wish wehadn't learned. I was privileged to be able to meet with the ReserveBank presidents up in Baltimore and I predicted that we were going tobe coming under increasing political risk. I think the Chairmanmentioned that earlier in his comments. Well, I think we saw thepolitical risk in the President's comments. Frankly, I didn't like itmuch. So, this weekend I began contemplating how we might respond tothat political risk. If this were Saturday, I might be quite temptedto want to stand strong in spite of what I think is evidence ofweakening economic activity. Governor Kelley pointed out some keyadvantages to our standing [firm]. I couldn't imagine a better testfor us to establish credibility. We have not only a Presidentialstatement but since the Beltway is within the Fifth District and I'veworked there, I've studied the matter rather closely. This was a veryunusual development for this Administration. They got everybodytogether to give background interviews. So, it was a pretty publicact of pressure on us. We'd clearly establish credibility if we stoodtall.Second, there have been arguments around the table which mayhave merit--but on balance I think they're probably wrong, though I'mquite uncertain about my own views--that we might be at a juncture, anunusual juncture, where an increase in short rates may actually helpM2 growth. The idea there is that we would stop the runoff intononbank depositories. And as someone who is very concerned about M2,although I don't agree with that description of the sign of theelasticity, I'm willing to admit that I might be wrong. I couldn'timagine a better [time] to experiment than right now [and to be]wrong. And thirdly, standing tall might have another advantage. It'samazing when I go out [in public] that everyone thinks we knowsomething that nobody else does. Given the amount of disagreementaround this table, it's unclear that we know anything, but they allthink we know something that nobody else does. And perhaps a sign ofstrength on our part might be a signal that in fact the economy isrecovering; it may be a self-fulfilling prophecy that might get thingsgoing.6/30-7/1/92So, I think the political lesson is that we are at an unusualjuncture. Were we to stand tall--perhaps we could even raise ratesand, who knows, really show our independence--we might produce somevery desirable results. We might have a tremendous bond market rallyand that could get the economy going. I have to view that as a longshot, though. But it's a long shot with a high payoff. I haven'tplayed golf in 15 years, so I'm not going to get into golf analogiesbut it would sound to me a bit like shooting a double eagle. Wouldthat make sense? I'm a more conservative player and I think our realrisks are very much along the lines of what President Corrigan said.And I think we have to get it right. We're not being asked to hit ahome run or a hole-in-one, but we are being asked to get a par, not abogey. On net I would have to go back to my economic training and towhat I think were both market tests to our behavior and also theoverall weakening that's epitomized in the change in the staffforecast. I would be inclined as a result of that to reject myinstincts to act tough and do what the economy says to me, and that isI'd be inclined to ease.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.MS. PHILLIPS. Well, I think I'm batting clean-up again. I'mgoing to change the analogy a bit because I feel as if we're runningboth the top and the bottom of the ninth inning at one time and thebases are loaded on both sides. In any case, I certainly agree withthe Greenbook forecast of a slow, modest, sluggish recovery. One ofthe things that seems to have changed since last time is the questionof how long this period of sluggishness is likely to continue. Thelonger it goes on, the more I am starting to question whether or notwe're going to start to lose consumers at some point and a slowdownwill begin. [Various] drags on the economy have been identified--the[financial] restructuring and the operating restructuring; the defenserestructuring is really only getting started at this point. We'restarting to see a fall-off in demand. While the confidence indexeslook better, as Mike indicated, they're still below their high points.I tend to wonder whether when people respond to the confidencesurveyors they say one thing but when they respond to the politicalsurveyors they say another thing, and thus we have a three-way race atthis point. The international side has started to weaken and, ofcourse, state and local government constraints may be starting to comein. I am encouraged about the progress on inflation. I tend towonder whether the concentration on the CPI or even the core CPI isperhaps overstating the price pressures that people are really feelinggiven this inability to raise prices, the bargain or sales shopping,and so on that are going on. So, I'm a little more encouraged aboutprice pressures than perhaps concentration on the CPI might indicate.The study and analysis of the monetary aggregates that we allappear to have engaged in since the last time do help to explain,partially, what has been happening in the monetary aggregates. Andthat I think is helpful. I wonder whether the banks, instead ofaggressively bidding for deposits, are now out making loans; I wonderif they're really out building their CRA files instead of spendingtime on loan development. In any case, we're not seeing the creditexpansion. So, I think we understand a bit more about the monetaryaggregates. Nevertheless, we're still seeing weakness in thoseaggregates. Again, if we concentrate only on looking at the Ms in theshort run we may not know too much, but in the long run I do think-33-6/30-7/1/92 -34-they tell us something. And we're having a [relatively] long periodof weakness in those aggregates, so I think that is disturbing. I doagree with Presidents Boehne and Corrigan that the key is employmentgrowth. And to the extent we have slow GDP growth--if it does dropdown below 2 percent for an extended period of time--we're going tohave some problems seeing sustained growth. So, while things haven'tchanged a lot substantively since the last time, it does seem to methat the length of time and the cumulating effect are heightening thedownside risk.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very much. We've come to abreak for the day; our next session commences at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.[Meeting recessed]6/30-7/1/92July 1, 1992--Morning SessionCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Shall we move on to the next item on theagenda which is the long-run ranges for monetary policy? I will callon Don Kohn to make his presentation.MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--seeAppendix.]CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Don?MR. PARRY. The staff projections are certainly veryimportant in terms of which of these alternatives should be selected.Typically in the past I think the way you have handled projections wasthat you took the difference between the actual and the forecast andhad that difference decay over the forecast period as an error.Judging from the discussion, I take it you're assuming that the errorpersists at the same level. Or do you have a different rate of decay?How did you get such a low number?MR. KOHN. Well, basically we assumed that the forces actingto raise velocity in the first half of the year would persist over thesecond half of the year. So, for example, relative to our standardmoney demand model, which has been missing for two years now, weassumed further shifts. Looking out to '93, and if we were to lookout further than that, I think we might assume that the additionalshifts would taper off; but we would not be tempted to assume that thelevel of velocity would tend to come back to what it was before. Thatis, if you interpret this as basically a shrinking of the depositorysystem for one reason or another, as I think the memo to the Committeenoted, some of that shrinkage might be a temporary reaction to theproblems of the past. But I think a lot of it must be permanent. Thesafety nets are being priced differently and people view depositoriesdifferently. So one wouldn't expect the level of velocity to comeback, say, to the old P* [assumption] but--MR. PARRY. So there's a different structure?MR. KOHN. I think it is a different structure. Clearly, onecould imagine without too much trouble that at some point in heregrowth rates will come back into alignment and that the growth of themonetary aggregates and the growth of nominal spending will movetogether again in a relatively predictable way. But I rather doubtthat the level would adjust back, and there's a lot of uncertaintyabout growth rates in the interim.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Black.MR. BLACK. Bob Parry's question raised something that hasbeen on my mind for some time. I think there are two ways to look atthese intermediate targets, or the long-term targets as we call themnow. One is that they are in fact medium-term targets. The otherextreme is to set these where we think the aggregates are going to beand not really think of them as targets. I think what Don has said isthat the reason he has suggested lower [growth rates] is that hethinks they are reasonable targets because of the downward shift inthe demand for money that we've seen, which makes [lower growth]perfectly justifiable. But I think it's a trap we can easily get-35-6/30-7/1/92into: setting these where we think they're going to be rather thanwhere we think they ought to be. I'm very much in favor of choosingtargets and making the aggregates behave the way we think they oughtto rather than just putting these out. I think the staff has done avery fine job in a very difficult environment in setting forth thenumbers that we have here. And I think Don would agree with what I'msaying.MR. KOHN. I would want to be clear though, President Black,that we have made our forecast based on the Greenbook projection fornominal income. So, if that projection is anything like what theCommittee wants it to be, then we would say that the monetary growthyou ought to want is something in the neighborhood of our projection,with this huge margin of uncertainty around all those things.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any other questions?MR. ANGELL. Don, when economic variables don't behave as ourbackground and our history suggest they should behave, it seems to methat we may have a tendency to think too soon that there will be areturn to the standard or what we would call "normal." Let me ask youwhat you think the risks are that this [unusual] behavior of M2 andits velocity has not yet peaked. What is the risk that M2 growthmight be even lower and V2 might be even higher than you anticipate?The reason I'm asking is because a 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range ispretty close [on the low side]. It doesn't do what Bob Blacksuggests, does it? That is, it doesn't really move the range down sothat we center it on 2 percent. So, my question is: What is theprobability that M2 growth might be substantially lower than 2 percentand V2 substantially higher?MR. KOHN. Well, we've set our [M2] projection, we hope, withthe risk balanced on both sides. Now, as Bob Parry remarked, we didlower it quite a bit this time relative to where we were last time; inthe February Bluebook I think we had 3-1/2 percent [M2 growth], orroughly the same as nominal GDP. So, we've gone from 3-1/2 to 2percent in stages. Quite frankly, my thinking was influenced a lot bythe expectation of a bounceback by May and June; we didn't get it. Infact, we are getting quite a bit of weakness and that has caused me toreevaluate this relationship, assuming that the economy has expandedas we expected over those months. So, we made this downward revision.I think we have it centered more or less in this wide sort of veryflat probability fan there. I couldn't say that there's noprobability that we would have higher velocity; of course, we couldhave larger velocity increases. At the same time, one issue here ishow the Committee wants to treat the possibility of even lower M2growth, i.e., how worried it should get about M2 or even M1 andwhether to put a little weight on that. While I would put theprobabilities of a greater velocity increase as obviously not zero,the Committee needs to consider how closely it wants to examine itsfederal funds rate target if money comes in weaker because it might betelling us something as well.MR. ANGELL. No, I wasn't suggesting that you weren'tbalanced; I was just suggesting that if you were projecting 5 percentgrowth and we had a range of 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, that a miss onone side would be a more serious---36-6/30-7/1/92MR. KOHN. Oh, I see. So, the fact that the range wasn'treduced even further to center it around 2 percent is what you'rereacting to?MR. ANGELL. Well, no. I would be historically at leastclose enough to Bob Black not to want to do that. But I think you'veanswered the question.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Syron.MR. SYRON. My question was the question that Wayne Angellasked. It was concern about the fact that we don't know when thecorrelation of errors is going to break and in which direction, andyou answered it absolutely as well as it can be answered.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. I have two questions. One is particularly tohelp me understand some of the terminology. Would you say a littlemore about what you meant when you started off about using theaggregates as an information variable? Aggregates have been used asan indicator in two different senses: sometimes to underline thethrust of monetary policy actions influencing economic activity andsometimes as a more timely indicator of information about what isgoing on in economic activity compared to national income accountinformation or other reports. Is there a tendency on the part of thestaff at this point to go one way or the another as to how you usethese as indicators?MR. KOHN. No. As I tried to indicate here, I would say thatI tend to use them a little both ways. In some sense, in terms of thecurrent situation, we have other information coming in about hoursworked and retail sales and this, that, and the other thing. So, thelead [time] of money [supply data] over that information, althoughit's subject to revision, isn't that great. It might give us a littlesense that things were developing somewhat differently than expectedbut we have a lot of other information coming in. So, I give it someweight that way. But the other issue is whether there are someforward-looking properties to it; and I think in the past there havebeen, although they have been rather loose. I think moneyencapsulates both our actions and the demands coming from the market,and one can see influences on them before one sees the influences inthe economy. So, in terms of this leading indicator property, I'ddifferentiate money from, say, the way we treated it from 1979 to 1982when M1 was the direct target of the Committee and we moved thefederal funds rate around very vigorously in a semi-automatic way inreaction to deviations in money growth from the path. Clearly, sincethe fall of 1982 it has been more of an information-indicator typevariable.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions for Don? Let meraise an issue which is more than tactics. The issue is how to handlethe problem that we have. I think the staff paper is extraordinarilygood; I certainly agree with Jerry on that. It pulled together mostof the crucial issues that have been discussed around this table forquite a while. I conclude from that paper as well as otherobservations that for the moment M2 is a proxy for the financing of asystem that is clearly broken down. I don't deny that it probably-37-6/30-7/1/92still has some shadow effect that we don't know the aggregatedimensions of, but the regressions that were employed to separate thedifferent types of money are regressions of a model or series ofmodels, all of which are unchanged over historic periods. Now, we doknow that M2 has been falling off the charts in the last couple ofyears; indeed, a lot of things have. The question we have to askourselves [relates to] the underlying assumption we're making--namely,that the structure that we're endeavoring to measure econometricallyis unchanged. If it is changed, then obviously one can't make anyassumptions even about the nature of the adjusted effects of M2. Thisis an issue that I suspect we're going to be looking at for a numberof months. With the degree of focus that we are giving to it, I wouldgather that we're going to learn more as we go on, as indeed I thinkthe evaluation of the more complex opportunity cost functions hasdemonstrated. We will learn things if for no other reason than wewill get more observations in this very crucial period, which willtell us about how nominal gross domestic product works its way throughthe intermediation process to M2-type components.This puts us in a very peculiar position only because we havea Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in front of us. I would gather that ifthat were not the case, we would be somewhat more relaxed at thispoint about how we're going to handle this. So, unless somebody canfind a better idea--and I must admit there are not great ones around--let me at least suggest as a fallback position that if we can't findanything better that essentially we communicate all of this discussionto the Congress. I suggest we say we are working on it and we willkeep them informed in a written form or something of that nature. Wewill send them an interim report on our progress, which could be everyquarter or what have you, and proceed not to change anything [at thismeeting]. In other words, I'm suggesting that we not change the 1992ranges and effectively pro forma allow the 1993 ranges to be the sameas the 1992 ranges. I suggest that only because if we do anythingother than that, we are presupposing that we have some knowledge aboutwhat is going on, which we don't have. So, we are caught in thisdilemma where if we make any changes at all it would be on the basisof an insight we're professing to have, which at this moment I suggestwe don't have. I don't feel comfortable with this as a conclusion; itmeans more work for Don. He doesn't even flinch; [maybe] he isn'tlistening! [Laughter] But unless somebody can think of a bettertactical procedure with respect to how we handle this.... I'm nottalking about the more important questions of what it does and how weinterlace policy. The issue of how we relate policy to the monetaryaggregates is something we're going to be struggling with on a veryintense basis for the period ahead, Humphrey-Hawkins to the contrarynotwithstanding. But I was raising this collateral, optical questionand issue. If anyone would like to comment on that, please do.Governor Lindsey.MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, I think you have laid out a verygood strategy for the approach to our Humphrey-Hawkins report. Basedon the conversation and particularly President Parry's question, Iwould like to note that from an a priori view we may know something.There are really three possibilities that we're considering, whichhave to do with the money demand curve shifting because of loanrepayments or runoffs of time deposits or what have you. The firstpossibility is that the shift in the demand curve is of a temporarynature and it will shift back. That means we believe small time-38-6/30-7/1/92deposits, for example, may come back in vogue in the future or thatbank margins somehow may [go] back down. If that's the case, thenvelocity will also bounce back and we are going to need a symmetrictolerance of M2 growth down the road. I think that gets to the heartof Jerry Jordan's question. The second possibility is that we have apermanent demand shift and we're going to see at some unknown point inthe future a new equilibrium emerge between the banking sector andother financial intermediaries, with permanently higher bank margins.If that's the case, then velocity will not bounce back but it willstop growing and we'll establish a new velocity relationship but notone where we have this continual 3 percent growth in velocity. And inthat case our M2 targets are going to have to be roughly what ournominal GNP targets are. The third possibility is what I would call acontinual demand shift: that forevermore we're going to see loanrepayments and runoffs of small time deposits. That would meanvelocity will always be shifting. We'll have, say, 3 percent velocityshifts every year. In that case, we should permanently lower ourmoney targets. Frankly, I find the continual demand shift modelincredible. If nothing else, there are only so many time deposits torun off; there are only so many loans to be repaid. But I think [theshift] will actually stop before that. So, I think we're torn betweenthe temporary demand shift and the permanent demand shift models. Ibelieve that informs our discussion and if anything, Mr. Chairman, itreinforces the view that you have just expressed.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. President Syron.MR. SYRON. Well, I agree quite strongly with where you comeout, Mr. Chairman. While we may approach it differently tactically,we all agree that the idea of Fed credibility is very, very important,particularly I would say at a time when, as you mentioned earlier,there are so many shifting sands in other areas. But I think wereinforce that credibility when we don't know something by saying wedon't know it rather than by pretending that we do. [That is] mygreatest fear when we go up [on the Hill]. I think Larry has outlinedthree alternatives quite well. My own view is that the structuralshifts are still going on and I agree with him in that I don't expectthem to go on forever. But I would be very concerned about making achange that would be predicated on the notion that we have some idea,with a measurable degree of precision, of where we are in this wholeprocess. I just don't think we are at that point. The more difficultproblem, as you indicated, is the pedagogical one: the timing. Andin that context I think we just ought to say that we don't have aprecise answer regarding what is going on and we'll keep [Congress]informed. It's an excellent strategy.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm with you about 95 percent ofthe way, which is a lower percentage than it usually is.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'll take it any time!MR. BLACK. But in the absence of some multi-year policystrategy such as the "tunnel" strategy that Governor Lindsey and I sobravely proposed back in December, which we all did not have thewisdom to accept, I think we have to look upon these one-year targetsthat we set now as sort of a mid-term benchmark. We don't know what-39-6/30-7/1/92the heck is going to happen, as you correctly said, so I think it'svery wise to stick to the 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent [M2 target] for thisyear. The main reason I would suggest that is not that I think we'relikely to be anywhere near the 6 percent, but that there is apossibility we might be there. And to have to change [the target]later on by raising it because we chose a range that was too low wouldreverse what we've been doing over a long period of time. There's abeautiful story in Appendix A of the Bluebook showing how, since about1980, we've been lowering these targets steadily over time, and Ithink that conveys an important message. But if we were to choose thelower range and then for some reason or other M2 or the otheraggregates were to strengthen and we had to raise the range, I thinkthat would muddle the thinking of the whole financial market and itwould be very bad. But by the same token, as we choose our targetthis time I think we ought to send an unambiguous message to themarkets that we have not lost sight of our long-term objective of goodeconomic growth with stable prices. And I would favor very stronglyadopting for 1993 a range of, say, 2 to 6 percent [or] one of therecommended ranges--say, 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent. Governor Angell andI discussed that last night. A 2 to 6 percent range would be mypreference because of the uncertainty, but 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percentwouldn't bother me either unless we got to the point that it reallywasn't enough and we had to raise that. So, I would really prefer the2 to 6 percent because I think that gives us enough room on thedownside to convince the market of what we really want to do and atthe same time enough to provide adequate financing for whatevereconomic growth we can get.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.MR. MELZER. That sounded like 50 percent agreement to me,Bob!MR. BLACK. It was higher than that!MR. MELZER. Alan, I'm in agreement with what you recommend.The only other comment I would make is that in principle I'd alignmyself with what Jerry was suggesting and I think Bob was suggestingin terms of what these targets represent. If, let's say, we wereexperiencing some temporary demand shifts or whatever but we stillfelt confident about longer-term relationships between money andincome, I would like to get to the point eventually where we set thetargets to be consistent with what we think is an environment of pricestability. In other words, we should gradually work them down to somelevel that we think is [unintelligible], explaining why we missed andnot get into the mode that Bob suggested of possibly moving thesetargets up and down based on what could be short-term [developments].That's a moot point in this context, I totally agree.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Implicit in my suggestion is that thisitem remains on the table until we get it resolved.MR. MELZER. Oh, I understand that. I'm just expressing myview on that point, but I totally agree with where you are right now.MR. BLACK. Just to reinforce that I was about 95 percentwith you, I think your suggestion that you explain this in yourHumphrey-Hawkins testimonies is absolutely vital.-40-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh, indeed.MR. BLACK. I strongly endorse that; I just forgot [tomention] it. But I'm 60/40 if--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So 50 and 60 adds up to 110!MR. PARRY. He's 1000 percent behind you!MR. SYRON. You have a narrower confidence; you're willing tosupport it with more precision than the precision we have in the Ms atthis point in time.MR. BLACK. Well, like Governor Lindsey, I think there's alimit to how far these things can go, but I don't know what it is. Ithink a lot of [the adjustment] probably is behind us because I don'tknow anybody who has thought about it at all who has not shifted moneyout of M2. I cited my mother-in-law who is 85 and has gone long-term.And the Chairman asked me if she was holding these for income. I saidprobably but she wasn't averse to taking a few capital gains if theycame. There has to be an end to this, but I don't know when it willbe. I think Don's group has done a very, very good job in addressingall the issues; it's one of the finest things they've done, yet I'msure they feel somewhat dissatisfied with it because it's so complex.If this target-setting gets any more complicated than it is today, itis going to mitigate to some extent the disappointment I have in notbeing able to participate in the next target-setting session. I don'tthink I could find one any more challenging than what we have today.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. I've agonized quite a bit over this issue ofuncertainty about the velocities and control in hitting targets versusthe information to the public at large--the need to announce thetargets and how that is stated. I would not like to see targetsannounced in such a way that we are lowering the ranges and theheadlines read "The Fed Tightens Policy" without [our action] beingtied to some other things that would condition that perception. I goback to what Bob Parry said yesterday afternoon in the first go-aroundas he concluded his statement about the importance of making ourlonger-run intentions clear. With the uncertainty or the discomfortover what is going on in the legislative and executive branches ofgovernment and the current political situation, it is not the rightmessage for this institution to say: "Well, if you thought that wasbad enough, we've lost our compass as well and we also are not sureabout the future and the outlook."The monetary aggregates, especially M2 with its longhistorical record despite all our uncertainty about M2 as currentlyput together, are still the best guide that we have for communicatingto people what the long-run outlook is. And we have to do what we canto say this will still serve for the foreseeable future. I was not apart of your deliberations not to lower the target range this year, soI'm not in a position of either saying "I told you so" or having todefend something now that was done without the considerable advantageof hindsight. I thought it was useful information to the public atlarge that the target ranges were gradually lowered year-by-year, witheither the upper or lower bound or both being brought down. Had that-41-6/30-7/1/92sequence been continued this year you would have [established a rangeof] 2 to 6 percent, which I think would have been very desirable, andwe would be looking at 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for next year and 1 to 5percent for the year after that and would be serious about it. Andthat would help people in thinking about the long run. We've been inthe situation very recently of being at the bottom end or even belowthe bottom end of the range, and people are wondering if we really areserious about the Ms. I thought the action in April couched in termsof M2 was a useful beginning toward saying we're really serious aboutit in a symmetrical way; if we're below the bottom end of the targetrange, we'll do something about it and try to get [money growth] up sothat people understand that the opposite is also true. Therefore, ifwe were at the top or above the top end of the range, we'd also beserious about that, so people would know that we are committed tomoving toward a growth rate of money that is consistent with pricestability. So, I would like to see the range reset this year at 2 to6 percent, where I think it should have been anyway. I'm in-betweenalternative I and alternative II. To go all the way to 1-1/2 percentnow and leave it there for 1993 would lose some information that Ithink is important. But if we leave the bottom end of the range at2-1/2 percent this year and have 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent again nextyear, then I think that we are bound to say "Here's what we're goingto do to make very certain that [M2 growth] is at least within therange rather than at the bottom end," and couple that with[appropriate] short-run actions.Just to cover what I would really like to see right now:[I'd favor] a very unusual event that should not necessarily be aprecedent for the future. I'd announce the ranges well in advance ofthe hearings--[the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings] being the customary wayto do it--coupled with a strong statement that we are serious aboutbeing within the range and are willing to engage in reserve supplyingoperations consistent with an expectation of lower interest rates[associated] with the lower monetary targets for '93. And especiallyimportant to me would be that this be done in a way that the Committeeis viewed as being solidly behind both the short-run action and thelong-run action. I'm very troubled by the perception of the pressthat changes in the funds rate up or down say something about ourlong-run commitment to growth versus inflation or the Phillips curve[tradeoff], or that sort of thing. So, [I'd suggest] an unusual pressconference approach announcing the ranges and the interest ratesexpected to be associated with them. And I'd not do that on the daythat the employment numbers come out so that we disassociate theaction and the announcement of what we want from a measure likeemployment or unemployment.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Jerry, suppose we are in a process nowof a major change in the role of intermediation in the financialsystem as a consequence of the decline in the franchise value of theintermediation process, significant increases in intermediation costs,statutory issues, and a major structural change involving one of thelarge elements in the intermediation process--the S&Ls. Suppose we inretrospect can look back on this period as one with a structuraldiscontinuity that doesn't change the long-term interface betweenvarious monetary aggregates, inflation, growth, and the like. Supposethat our P* model requires a level adjustment but then proceeds andworks as well as before. It will turn out that we will be back to anappropriate process of where we should be and how we should be doing-42-6/30-7/1/92that, but it will also turn out that this particular period will be aperiod of structural change that will create a deceptive [impression]with respect to how the aggregates are being employed either formonetary policy purposes or as indicators of what is going on in thefinancial structure of the system. And until we know that or until wehave a sense of that, we would be taking a risk in doing what you'resuggesting. I say that as one who philosophically agrees fully withthe position you've just stated. I do think that we should be workingour way down to a stable price environment and at that point then holdthe money supply within a relatively stable, modest range--whatever wemay decide that should be. But having said that, it would be an actof faith on my part to do what you're suggesting because itpresupposes we know the answer to something I'm afraid we don't.MR. JORDAN. I appreciate that uncertainty. Presumingknowledge that we don't have is very troubling to me. I think thatwhat you have described is the case. I agree that we're in some kindof transitional period to an environment that we will all easilyrecognize 10 years from now, looking back upon the period as maybe anearly 1960s [type of] world in terms of inflation and interest ratesand various relationships. It is also a risk to see things like totalbank reserves down for the month of June and M1 or M2 or [some other]measure down. The whole array of [monetary measures] is contractingand we are not taking action to do something about it. I'm afraidthat if we back away from the aggregates generally, especially M2 inthe way it has guided this Committee in the past, that we will simplybe looking through the aggregates to real economic activity. And--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Not necessarily. I think we'll belooking through the aggregates to the total financial system; what Ithink we actually will do is to try to use the aggregates as a proxyfor a much broader view of a very complex financial system. What weshould appropriately do is to try to look through [the monetarymeasures] into what in fact is going on in the financial system. Ifindeed there are other factors that are suggesting that movements inthe aggregates in the most recent weeks are pointing to something, weshould begin to see it in certain areas of the system other thannominal gross domestic product or any of the real variables. I don'tthink any of us would wish to argue that if we see financialconstriction occurring in which the aggregates are merely indicationsof other developments, that action wouldn't be an appropriate thing toput on the table. Obviously, I think it would be. In fact we'll bediscussing in our next segment whether or not that is indeed the case.MR. JORDAN. I've taken some comfort previously from the factthat M2 was at the bottom of the range but Ml was off the top of thecharts, the monetary base was growing very rapidly, and bank reserveswere growing very rapidly. Given that, I concluded that probably thetruth was someplace in between; M2 was probably understating stimulusand Ml and other [measures] were overstating it. Now, it's only onemonth of information, and I don't want to put too much [emphasis on]that, but I am uncomfortable with the idea that [all the monetarymeasures] seem to be contracting all at once.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, that's a most legitimate concern,and I don't think any of us would---43-6/30-7/1/92MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I don't see a lot of difference inthe approaches the two of you are suggesting except that I think Jerrywould favor reducing the range next year because of the signal effect.Otherwise it seems to me you have said essentially the same things, asI've understood you. That's the point I was trying to make.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think the difference basically is thatI would prefer not to make a firm statement about 1993 until we knowsomething beyond what we know at this particular moment. At the pointwhen we can again say that we know something about the way M2 orwhatever [measure] we're using at that time is responding, then we cantie that to our long-term goals in a manner which emphasizes what thevery general policy of this Committee is.MR. BLACK. I would much prefer that if we had the option.But if we should take a step toward [ease] either through adoption ofa directive that is asymmetrical toward ease or through dropping thefederal funds rate, I think we badly need something out there for thefuture that says we have not abandoned our long-term quest for pricestability. And that's why I--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would say, frankly, that it'sessential that we do that in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, no matterwhat we do at this table. At this particular period in time toreemphasize our commitment to price stability over the longer run as afundamental goal of the FOMC is fully appropriate independently ofwhat our discussions [today] or otherwise are with respect to theissue of the ranges.MR. BLACK. I was sure you would feel that way. I just feelthat some tangible movement in cutting the aggregate ranges would benecessary and make that as believable as I would like it to be.MR. JORDAN. That's why I was suggesting coupling them onjust this one occasion. While they are independent in some respects,as I said, I wouldn't be happy to see a headline that says "FedTightens Policy" if we lower the ranges; but I also wouldn't be happyto see a headline saying "The Fed Caves In" if we cut the funds rate.MR. BLACK. That's my problem.MR. JORDAN. Putting the two together and announcing therange and an expectation of lower rates in order to achieve these[monetary growth objectives] is an important message about the future.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I very strongly support yourrecommendation. I think you put your finger on the issue correctlywhen you indicated that were it not for Humphrey-Hawkins we probablywouldn't even be having this discussion. As a matter of fact, I wouldlike to see us spend a little time thinking about how we can get outof this Humphrey-Hawkins box entirely. But that's another issue andit's particularly unrealistic [to address it] at this time. Due toall the uncertainties surrounding the aggregates generally andparticularly M2 at the moment, I think we'd be making a big mistake topay too much attention to them and in effect to chase them by loweringthe ranges either for '92 or '93. This is not to say that we should-44-6/30-7/1/92ignore the aggregates; they do contain information that we have tolook at, but certainly over a longer period of time. So, I think ourbest strategy at the moment with the Congress is to communicate fully.After all, that is what the Humphrey-Hawkins is all about--not so muchthe setting of the ranges but delineating to the Congress what ourintentions are over the longer term both with respect to [economic]growth and prices. So, I think we can explain the shortfall in M2adequately; and with so many uncertainties, to change the range for'93 now would be a mistake. And, of course, we have the opportunitysince this is only a tentative setting of the ranges anyway to make achange in January or February. And by that time, hopefully we willhave learned a little more about the behavior of the aggregates. So,I think your recommendation is right on target.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Angell.MR. ANGELL. Mr. Chairman, Bob Black got into part of myquestion but I want to follow it up. I just have two questions andthen, depending on your answer, I'll respond. Our commitment to pricelevel stability has in it, in a sense, the background that we thoughtwe were going to be lowering these M2 targets until we got down to anM2 growth rate that was consistent with price stability. I believemany of us thought that it meant "never-never land"--that maybe atsome point in time M2 growth rates of 1 to 4 percent or somewhere inthat area would be consistent with price level stability if we didn'thave something going on with regard to the aggregates. After thehigher costs of intermediation have worked their way through--and Ithink Larry Lindsey is right that these [adjustments] can't go onforever, at least not in one direction--what in your mind would be anappropriate M2 target consistent with price level stability in thatfuture out there?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I don't want to say that I knowfor sure, but let's define a couple of issues. While Larry Lindsey isright that the adjustment can't go on forever, what he's really rightabout is that it can't go on at the rate of change that we now arelooking at. It's really the second difference that he's raising fromthis perspective.MR. ANGELL. Sure.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If we are using the franchise value ofintermediaries--in other words, if in effect technology is graduallychanging the fundamental purpose of commercial banking with its so-called credit knowledge capabilities so that securitization becomesincreasingly the means of financing--one can envisage a very smallintermediary sector. In principle one can visualize zero; there's noconceptual reason why a market economy as complex as ours cannotfunction with direct finance, provided of course that there is[unintelligible] part of securitization and other mechanisms fortransactions balances and the like or a narrow banking system. So, Iwant to say that over the long run it matters what we are measuring.I can envisage the current definition of M2 actually being consistentwith a trend in which unit M2, that is the ratio of M2 divided bypotential real gross domestic product, falls relative to the level ofprices, meaning it's a sort of P* with a trend. Now, I don't knowwhat that is at this particular moment. What I'm reasonably certainof is that to the extent there is a sign, if I may put it that way, it-45-6/30-7/1/92is negative. That is another way of saying that income velocity is along-term constant; that's the same thing as saying that the pricelevel is proportional to unit money supply. Now, I'm saying that isthe outside limit as far as I can judge of what is occurring and thatthe only thing that may happen is basically that we're getting to along-term uptrend in velocity, which is the obverse of the decline ofthe intermediation process. I don't know what the number is; all I'msaying essentially is that in the context of a constant long-termvelocity an appropriate guide to monetary policy may be somewhat lessthan a 1 to 4 percent range.MR. ANGELL. The second question is: If you believe as youand Bob were indicating in your interchange that price level stabilityneeds to be a significant part of the Humphrey-Hawkins report--and youknow I agree with that--what alternate form of communication do youpropose [to convey] that that's what we are out to do and the mannerin which we want to do it? What would substitute for Jerry Jordan's 2to 6 percent range that some of us voted for last year and pullingthat down? I'm open to another program.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me say the only program that'sinvolved here is a short delay until we get the issue resolved becauseI think at some point we have to revisit [the question of the rangesfor] 1993. And I wouldn't necessarily wait until February if we'vecome to a conclusion before then.MR. ANGELL. Well, you see my question stems from a view thatthere is something resembling a Wicksellian natural rate of interestprevailing in the critical 5-year, 7-year intermediate interest ratearea, and we have tacked onto that Wicksellian natural rate anuncertainty premium in regard to inflation because the world doesn'tknow what we're doing. What I'm asking is: What do we say? How dowe explain our action? What is the guidepost that causes the bondmarkets around the world to understand the nature of our commitment?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are you talking about what we say in theHumphrey-Hawkins testimony?MR. ANGELL. Yes.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would say that we'd have to do itverbally and do it in a manner which specifies that we're working onthis and that when we come to a conclusion we'll announce it.MR. ANGELL. Well, I am so committed to such a proposal and Ihave such questions about M2, which we're working on, that I'mcertainly willing to consider an alternative that has that kind ofcommitment to explain to the world exactly what it is that guides us.And it indicates in a sense the rigors of monetary policy. You know,gold standards aren't marvelous deals; the only thing gold standardsdo is that they ensure some kind of discipline that will remain there;if you stay with that game, you don't have the luxury of doing what'spopular. What we have to do is to indicate some better system thanthat, which would give the world the confidence we need so that we canget economic growth restored.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If the judgment of this Committee isright--to the extent I can infer from the various statements different-46-6/30-7/1/92people have made--I would contemplate, [indeed I think] it's quiteconceivable, that we may end up in the latter part of 1993 and into1994 with significant acceleration of economic activity in the contextof a much lower inflation rate than we are looking at now. If thatwere the scenario and if we were at that point in a moderate financialposture as a central bank, I would say that the message would havebeen very well delivered and that we would have created a very highdegree of central bank credibility. Now, the problem we have is thetremendous uncertainties about what is going on at this moment notonly with respect to the economy but with respect to the money supply.It's very difficult to develop any firm footing because we have to becareful not to put our foot down solidly when we don't know whetherwhat is underneath is firm. I think we have very little choice. If Ipersonally thought that at this stage we had in the pipeline a levelof inflationary liquidity in the system, I would say that we would bein a wholly different environment than what I think we're in. Thenthe issue you are raising would disturb me quite a great deal. But Idon't think that is the case, which means that I don't think that ourhaving difficulty with this issue is or should be more than atechnical problem now rather than what it could be, which would berather dangerous. As Jerry Jordan points out, if the view were thatall of a sudden the Federal Reserve has lost its footings, then Ithink we'd be in real difficulty.MR. ANGELL. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I think that a statementin the Humphrey-Hawkins from you that indicates our commitment to thisprogram and our expectations of some success--almost a Bundesbank-likecommitment to price level stability--without any monetary aggregatesin it, would work. But that's a pretty tough step for us to take.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I think what we would do is torepeat basically what we have [said] before because we're testifyingbefore Steve Neal.MR. ANGELL. Yes, he's very friendly.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, and what we are subscribing to isbasically Steve Neal's proposition. We've already done that, and itis not--nor should it be perceived as--a shift in policy for thisinstitution.MR. ANGELL. Well, I can go with your recommendation withthis interchange as background, and I thank you.MR. MELZER. Alan, just to clarify: Your proposal for '93would be just to stick with what we had in '92 and explain? It's notto say that we have nothing for '93.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I'm basically saying that what weare doing is putting in a marker temporarily.MR. MELZER. Right. And that will be what we had in '92?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That is correct.MR. MELZER. Okay. If we do that, I think a lot of thepublic is not going to look at the nuances, though some people will.But they would really notice if there were nothing there.-47-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, I think we have to put something inas a holding position.MR. MELZER. I agree.MR. BLACK. You said you didn't want to put your foot downfirmly, Mr. Chairman; I think 2 to 6 percent would not be putting yourfoot down firmly like 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent would be.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. A 2 to 6 percent range presupposes thatwe know something in order to move from one range to the other, and Ifeel uncomfortable about that.MR. BLACK. I understand. You're in a very defensibleposition; you're a very persuasive person; you have higher credibilitythan anybody in the country. But if we don't lower that range, Ithink people are not going to believe everything you say. That iswhat I'm afraid of.MR. ANGELL. In a sense that's the problem we had a year ago.When we talked about the range for '92 we said: "Well, let's just putthe tentative marker down and leave it alone." Then when we got toFebruary we said: "Well, we really don't want to change our tentativemarker." So our tentative marker last year got to be a little moresolid than some of us had hoped.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But then we believed that when we lookedat M2 we were looking at something that--MR. ANGELL. Well, I didn't think we were and I didn't thinkDon thought we were. I thought M2 was a problem a year ago.Opportunity costs and M2 velocity were running off the charts a yearago, so we knew we had a problem.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I knew we had a problem; it's not likethe problem we have now, I tell you! President Parry.MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, I certainly would support yourrecommendation for 1992, particularly with the explanation of theuncertainties. I really do think there is a far better alternativefor 1993. It seems to me that if we were to reduce the range by 1/2percentage point, there are some things we could say that would make agreat deal of sense. First of all, we could indicate that theuncertainties are likely to persist, and I'm sure we feel that way.The staff projections would be more consistent with that range thanthe current range. And most importantly, it would be consistent withour view that over the long term we have this objective of pricestability. I don't see anything to lose. That doesn't mean thatwe're changing it and the uncertainties have disappeared. What itmeans is that we believe that at some point in the reasonable futurethose uncertainties are likely to disappear. But there is no reason[not] to take small steps in that direction. As a matter of fact, Ithink there will be a large group in financial markets and otherplaces who would misinterpret the meaning of our staying with theexisting targets for two years. And I don't see what we give up atall by just reducing the range 1/2 percentage point. It's consistentwith the long term; it's consistent with the projections; and it's-48-6/30-7/1/92consistent with the idea that the uncertainties are temporary. I seeno problem.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, I would support yoursuggestion. I have just a couple of comments to tack on. First ofall, in terms of this discussion about credibility and price stabilityand so on, I'm a believer in what we do, not what we say. In tryingto get a point of view across to the Congress and the public, it'sobviously important, as a number of people suggested, that we reaffirmthat. But it's also not a bad idea to look at the record. And therecord of the past five or six years, including 1992, in terms ofmoney growth is pretty darn good. Not only is it darn good in anarithmetic sense [unintelligible] in terms of achieving pricestability, but the fact of the matter is that this Committee has showna great deal of stick-to-it-ness over the past three years in acontext in which the performance of the economy by most standards hasbeen lousy. I think we have a darn good story to tell. So, I wouldtell both sides of the story: I would put some real emphasis not juston saying what we're thinking about for the future but what we havedone. I think it's a very good story.Now, the other comments I want to make are that I agree verymuch with this rather cute little idea of yours of keeping theCongress informed, but I wouldn't go too far in that direction orthey'll have you up there every Thursday afternoon after the moneysupply statistics are released! So, I think we have to hang loosethere a little.The last point I want to make, and I think it's moreimportant, is that clearly part of what we're seeing here is this atleast temporarily changed [financial] intermediation process. And Ithink it's appropriate to put emphasis and perhaps a good deal ofemphasis on that. But there's more to it than that. That is partlythe reason I made the comment yesterday, and I've made it before, thatif it were just M, whatever M you want, that looked funny, thatargument would be quite credible. But it's not just M whatever; it'sthe whole shooting match that looks funny. Therefore, at the veryleast, I think in your explanation you have to try not to get too tiedto this intermediation issue itself. The other thing that obviouslycan be brought to bear is the debt restructuring and all that. That'sanother way of saying that the questions that are running around in mymind go well beyond just the disintermediation phenomenon and the roleof the intermediaries, short term and long term. I'm cautious aboutbetting the ranch on that issue. The only other point I'd make inconcluding, just to complicate matters further, is that if I wantedto, I could make a pretty good argument that price stability couldturn out to be quite compatible with higher rates of growth of themoney supply rather than lower. That again is just another way ofsaying that we're in a heck of a box in terms of how definitive wecould be about much of anything.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Syron.MR. SYRON. I just want to ask a question of Bill McDonough.I'm taking the opportunity [now], but the question is one that wasmore relevant earlier. I think we're talking about tactics here. I-49-6/30-7/1/92have a fair amount of sympathy for the message [and] the credibilitywe want to [earn]. But the concern I have and the reason I stronglysupport staying with the existing ranges is that I simply don't thinkwe know enough. I'm deeply concerned that to lower the range by 1/2percentage point--the question I want to ask Bill McDonough is relatedto this--would say that we think we know something with some degree ofprecision. We have three audiences: the financial markets, thepublic, and the Congress. The question I have for Bill is whether inthis environment, looking particularly at the financial markets, heagrees with my perception that the markets think the Ms are ratherconfused at this point and whether they would put a lot of weight onthe credibility side if we lowered the [bottom of the] range from2-1/2 to 2 percent.MR. MCDONOUGH. If the Chairman makes a very strong statementwithout putting himself in too much of a box--in that regard I wouldsupport President Corrigan--that there is a commitment on the part ofthe FOMC to price stability, I think that is what is important. Andit can be done in a way in which holding the M2 [range] as theChairman suggests is going to be fully acceptable to the market. Ithink the market would say this: "If you say that you really areuncertain about what is going on in the monetary aggregates andtherefore are going to leave them alone, that's fully understandable.If you say you don't know what is going on in the monetary aggregatesand are studying it and are going to come up with an answer but in themeantime you are going to change the range, the story doesn't holdtogether." I think the market is always very confused about a storythat doesn't hold together and is very accepting of a spokesman with[the Chairman's] degree of credibility saying: "We're not sure; we'restudying it; and we're going to come up with an answer as soon as wehave one." That's a very comprehensible, understandable, believablestory.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.MR. STERN. I strongly support your recommendation. At thisjuncture--and this has been said a couple of times already--our firstobligation is to tell the Congress what we know and what we don't knowabout M2. I think we know a good deal more than we knew at the lastmeeting but we certainly have not resolved all the uncertainties. Inany event, we should share that with the Congress; and putting a greatdeal of emphasis on the ranges in this context just doesn't make a lotof sense to me. So, leaving the ranges where they are is fine withme. From an institutional point of view or a credibility point ofview, being direct with the Congress is the way to go in anenvironment where it is widely recognized that there are some changingrelationships and some mystery with regard to the aggregates and maybeother credit and financial variables as well. That will enhancecredibility rather than undercut it. We're not going to fool anybodyby pretending that we have some insights that we don't have, at leastat this point.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.MR. HOENIG. I would support your approach, although I have alot of sympathy for Jerry Jordan's comments. The difficulty, asothers here have said, is that we are in transition; we are uncertain.In that position, changing targets--whichever way--leaves open so many6/30-7/1/92questions that I think it will only confuse the participants, and thatis unwise. So, I'd go along with your recommendation. I'd carefullyexplain it and, as Jerry Corrigan said, make a little [comment] on ourrecord and our commitment to price stability in that context. I thinkthat will be accepted better than our suggesting that we knowsomething when we don't.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.MR. KELLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman I strongly support yoursuggestion. And for the reasons that have just been articulated bymany, I don't think there's a thing in the world wrong with[acknowledging] uncertainty and [exercising] great caution in the faceof basically changing conditions and a situation in which we don'tknow where those conditions are going to resettle. I don't think anyapology or any excuse whatsoever is necessary. It would be a mistakeif we were to try to bluff our way through and say that we know morethan we know or alternatively, at the other end of the spectrum, if wewere to stick our head in the sand and say: "Never mind, we are stillgoing to fly on the same old instruments." I don't think either ofthose courses would be credible. The key to credibility and integrityhere is to be candid about this situation. We are working hard toreformulate the guidelines to policy [to foster] new understandingwhen that's possible to do. I'm not sure when it will be possible todo, which is the only other point I would like to make. I think wehave to discipline ourselves and probably educate the Congress and thepublic to the fact that it may take some time before it's possible todo that again. It may be a while before conditions are sufficientlystable for us to have some confidence that we understand where we areand for things to have settled down so we are able to reformulate ourbasic guiding stars.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Mullins.MR. MULLINS. I would support your proposal. I do thinkthere's a case for cutting [the range] a half point in 1993. It seemsto me that it's simply time to do so in the normal rhythm of things.It was not unusual to skip last year. In the summer of '88 theCommittee cut the ranges for the following year, skipped '89, cut in'90, and skipped '91. The difficulty is that it's '92 now and in thenormal pattern it would be time to move. It would put the market onnotice, independent of federal funds rate moves and other policymoves. The difficulty I see--and the reason I would agree with yourproposal--is that it's simply difficult to send a clear signal in thecurrent environment with the context of a distorted M2; it's difficultto separate the policy target from the questions of distortions of M2.What we lose is that we muddle the signal. I think there's no way toavoid the suspicion that we're moving the target down in part becauseM2 is weak. And I think we would have a better signal of long-termpolicy and our targets after this is better understood. It'sunfortunate because we are moving up to a period where we have thecapacity for reassessment of that inflation premium that GovernorAngell talked about. And I am concerned when I look at what themarket expects later this year and next year: They expect rates to goup. By setting the fed funds rates we'll get precious little marketinformation on when to do that. Money hasn't been a reliable signal.So, I am a bit concerned that we'll find ourselves following themarket up, lagging, and chasing credibility. And one way to try to-51-6/30-7/1/92get ahead of it is to put the market on notice and send the signalearly. I think we'll have a much clearer picture in the months ahead;and maybe we will not have to wait until February because I tend tothink that much of this may be transitory. We'll see how the timedeposit refugees feel if the stock market gets a little cool here! Ido expect the yield curve to flatten in at least two ways. And Ithink the de-leveraging is running its course. It is true that wehave these higher costs of intermediation which have already given thebanks all-time record profits in the first quarter. So, they seem notto be suffering too much. Therefore, I think there is a case forcutting the ranges at this time. But the difficulty is that we wouldlose the signal in this environment, so I would support your proposal.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Keehn.MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, I completely agree with yourproposal and support it for the reasons that you stated. The onlything I would add is that by lowering the ranges it's just possiblethat we might send some signal to the people who are viewing ouroutlook and expectations for the economy in terms of the [monetary]growth rate. I just don't think that's the signal we want to send.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor LaWare.MR. LAWARE. I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman, butI just have a nervous reaction as to how much we tell the world thatwe don't know. This is a jittery kind of situation. We have anunusual political situation and an uncertain trend to the economicrecovery that most of us, I think, believe is genuine. And thisinstitution is considered one of the anchors, one of the stablefactors in this whole political and economic environment. If we aretoo forthcoming about how little we know about M2, which is the[measure] on which we have hung all of our policy rationale for thepast several years, frankly I think that could be a very destabilizingelement in the whole environment. So, I'd just caution that we shouldbe very careful as to how much we say about how little we know.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.MS. PHILLIPS. Clearly, we're in this terrible gray area thatGovernor Kelley talked about yesterday. I'm having a bit of a hardtime separating the discussion on the longer-range goals and theshort-term action. To try to comment on the goals outside of somediscussion about the short-term action I find a little difficult. Itseems to me that if they were taken in conjunction, we'd have anopportunity to give two messages: A message about the strength of theeconomy and at the same time a signal with respect to our seriousnessabout inflation. As a citizen I also have some difficulty settinggoals that we have no chance of meeting and that we're not intendingto meet. In a managerial sense I've generally thought of goal-settingas something that makes a statement as to where one wants to go. Idon't think goals are always set in an environment where one has fullknowledge of all of the variables that make up what goes into thosegoals. So, I'd rather see a bit of a conjunction in the message thaton the one hand we're going to ease to try to deal with the economybut at the same time we are making a statement about inflation withrespect to our longer-run objectives.-52-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendationprimarily because I don't have a better idea. But I share GovernorLaWare's sentiment that it's rather tricky trying to enhance ourcredibility by admitting that we don't know what is going on.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Lindsey.MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, let me ask a question. Iprobably misunderstood what you said the first time in light of yourlater comments, particularly your answer to Governor Angell. If infact we go up [to Congress] and say that we are uncertain about wherethings are temporarily, that's one thing. The question I have is: Ifwe think, as you suggested, that a continual demand shift may be goingon, then aren't we really throwing monetary aggregates out the windowon a permanent basis?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I don't think so because the type ofshift that I was discussing is a long-term shift, in which what we'redealing with is a relatively small "add factor" not a short-term oreven a major [unintelligible] break.MR. LINDSEY. So, you would expect within the foreseeablefuture that we would be back to some kind of stable money/incomerelationship?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would certainly think so.MR. LINDSEY. Is it your expectation that that will be by '93perhaps?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'm going to comment when we get to thenext agenda topic, the short-term [decision], on what I think is goingon in the economy, which is not unrelated to that. Let me try toanswer that question in that context because I need [to cite] somebackground to give you my point of view.MR. LINDSEY. My third question about what you were sayingis: Are you going up there with no anchor at all? In other words, ifyou say that temporarily we're not looking at M2, I think MiltonFriedman and others have--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I'm not saying that.MR. LINDSEY. Oh, good. Okay.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We are saying that we are looking at it.We're saying nothing more than we have basically said [before]. Inother words, we are not saying it is meaningless. To say it ismeaningless is a statement of knowledge. What we're saying is thatsomething that had relationships has gone off the track. Thatbasically stipulates that for this particular time it has no meaning;it is a state of knowledge we don't have. Indeed, it may bereflecting something quite significant, but we don't know that.MR. PARRY. Implicit in your statement is that you wouldexpect that uncertainty to continue through 1993?-53-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I don't know. I'm saying I expectthat the uncertainty will continue enough that we will not get throughthe next Humphrey-Hawkins hearings with any real insight into what isgoing on. It may well be that by September or October we'll have amuch better sense of what is going on and a much better feel of whatthe relationships are. I might add that under those conditions Iwould think we would then take a firm shot at 1993. I myself wouldnot be disinclined, under those conditions, to go lower.MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, I think confusion demonstrateswhy you're such a wonderful person to represent the Fed.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I don't know if I like that but goahead! [Laughter]MR. LINDSEY. Well, I mean you managed to convince us all. Imust admit I'm puzzled but--MR. ANGELL. In other words you find it hard to vote the sameway that I vote?MR. LINDSEY. In view of the fact that you are on the otherside of the table I'm not surprised. I look forward to seeing yourHumphrey-Hawkins testimony, Mr. Chairman, in a tactical sense.[Laughter] But I appreciate your answer to the question and thatwe're not abandoning M2.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I have no intention of doing thatbecause I, frankly, think it would be a mistake.MR. LINDSEY. Okay.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's the question of interpreting whatwe're looking at that's crucial. President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. I have both a question about how this would beexplained and also a recommendation. But before I get to either Ihave a couple of comments that may sound like digressions but to me atleast they have a point. First, I'm in somewhat of an uncomfortableposition having written in 1982 very positively and glowingly aboutthe good relationship between Ml and nominal GNP and the stability ofM1 velocity over the prior 20 odd years just at about the time it wasbreaking down. So, I am hesitant about riding a horse that is in theprocess of change. Some 20 to 25 odd years ago or more, there was alot of discussion in this Committee, in System committees on thedirective, and in academic circles about technological change andinnovation--what was going on in the financial system--suggesting thatthe relationship between the narrow aggregate, Ml. and economicactivity would break down because of velocity growing extremelyrapidly due to things like sweep accounts, point-of-sale transactions,automatic transfers, credit card utilization, and so on. The idea wasthat the demand for some narrow measures of transactions liabilities,maybe even currency, would decline and so velocity would [grow].Well, we had exactly the opposite in spite of all that wisdom thatwent into what would be wrong with Ml.In the late 1970s there was a great deal of work done, someby the Board's staff, some by staff of the Reserve Banks and by-54-6/30-7/1/92economists of commercial banks--the ABA advisory committee was veryactive in it--assisting in the effort to try to improve control of thenarrow monetary aggregates. That wound up in the 1980 omnibuslegislation. The way we got to the single uniform reserve ratio onall transactions liabilities was that we wanted to crown M1. Wewanted to reduce the variability of the multiplier so that whenbalances shifted from Reserve City banks to country banks, members,nonmembers, savings and loans and on and on, we stopped getting allthe noise we were getting. We entered into this legislation with BobWeintraub's help [unintelligible]. That may have helped in the veryshort-run sense because nothing happened with Ml; [that] would do usno good at all in terms of M2. My question first before therecommendation is: If the targets were not changed for '92 and '93,would that be accompanied--in addition to a statement that we'restudying this and we're comfortable being below the target rangepending results of studies and we're not going to do anything--by afairly clear indication that we're not going to lower the range and weare going to [take] actions intended to bring the growth back withinthat range?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'd be more inclined to imply--or evento state if necessary--that if the money supply were on track or weunderstood it, it would be the inclination of this Committee to lowerthe ranges. In other words, I'd make a statement that it's thephilosophy of this Committee to move the ranges down, but in thiscontext, prior to an understanding as to what the appropriatestructure is, no action is being taken. My own inclination is tosuggest that the view of the Committee--if we decide to go the way Iwas suggesting and I was just raising it as a suggestion--is that wewould reiterate the long-term goals that we have previously stated andidicate that we do not believe that [the current] range captures thelowest level that we ultimately wish to achieve and that there is afurther step to be taken. Don, am I correct that it was the lasthearing--or was it a year ago?--when we originally moved to this levelfor the ranges and we stipulated that this was a way station to alower level? I think reiterating that as our general purpose for ourlong-term strategy can be done without getting involved in actuallysaying that we would move the [ranges] down. That would imply thatwhen the numbers have gotten back on track and we understand them,that the notion would reassert itself in the then context ofrelationships that we figure are stable.MR. JORDAN. Given that response, I guess I come out whereBob Parry suggested in that he doesn't see what the cost is of--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The cost is basically what has beenraised by Governor Mullins and others: There is a danger here that wecould be moving the ranges not as a [matter of] policy but as apragmatic [adjustment] merely because we are more or less getting themdown to where the numbers are. It's a very difficult thing to fight.It looks like an opportunistic as distinct from a principled action.MR. JORDAN. My recommendation then is that we indicate inaddition to the point that we are very seriously studying theserelationships that we also are going to do more than just study thisand we're going to be making recommendations in order to enhance boththeir control and maybe their relationship with economic activity. Mypreferred recommendation for some time on that idea is to move to a-55-6/30-7/1/92system, which would require legislation, of a single very low reserveratio applied to all non capital liabilities. On M2, we don't want asingle reserve ratio as we currently have only on transactionsliabilities and not on nontransaction liabilities. We have thisoddity of unbound banks and surplus vault cash and on and on whichconfuses the issue even as to what total reserves are in the usual wayof thinking. My guess is that [the single reserve ratio] would bewell under 5 percent. It would both correct the competitive inequityproblems in the banking industry today caused by the way FDICinsurance is assessed in combination with Reg D and the way we imposereserve requirements whether they're domestic oriented or funded[unintelligible] pay the higher tax or franchise fee than does awholesale bank or money center bank.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Jerry, I think there's considerablesympathy around this table for that view. Remember that the originalposition regarding reserves on transactions balances largely reflecteda view as to how this Committee would function operationally when thelegislation was passed. Now that is no longer the case. If peopleare going to focus on M2, we would clearly want to look at thequestion of why we have reserves on transactions balances only. Thatis a very legitimate question. We have to look at the problem we mayhave with it, which is that if we do that something else will pop.It's not something that we can automatically get involved in becausewere we to do that, as we study it--which I'm sure is in fact yourpurpose--we probably would get a far greater ability to stabilize M2growth but at the cost of significantly more volatile interest rates,at least in the short run. So, an interesting set of questions isinvolved, but it's a quite legitimate issue to be raised because Ithink there is a fundamental inconsistency in our approach to havetargets for aggregates which we effectively can't control. I'm notsure we can control M2.MR. ANGELL. That's the big point.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Mullins.MR. MULLINS. A point of clarification: As I understand it,the proposal is to set tentative preliminary ranges for '93 and thatwe could revisit this, say, in October or November and actually changethe ranges then rather than wait until February.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, in fact that's precisely--MR. MULLINS. Why don't we put it on the agenda as we getmore information and this will give us another opportunity to saysomething instead of saying that we have--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What are you getting at?MR. MULLINS. Well, on the FOMC meetings as we go forwardwhen it comes time to consider this, let's just put it [on theagenda].CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do it formally?MR. MULLINS. Yes, do it formally.-56-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, I think that's--MR. MULLINS. Then we're communicating not just that we havedecided to postpone until February consideration of--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I have not intended to imply that wewould. That's the reason I said that we'd be sending up interimreports from the Committee.MR. MULLINS. It might be useful to do it in October orNovember.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, supposing we--MR. MULLINS. If we're not ready, it would not be useful!CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would say in the Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony that it's our expectation that this issue would be revisitedas soon as feasible, hopefully by the fall or whenever we're ready.MR. MULLINS. Yes, I wouldn't expect you to commit in theHumphrey-Hawkins testimony but just for our own planning.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, for our own planning this is on theagenda until we resolve it; it's on every six weeks with a report fromDon because I don't think that we can put this aside until thequestion has been addressed. President McTeer.MR. MCTEER. Just an observation, Mr. Chairman: I believeit's true that over past periods when we've observed stable velocityof various Ms, it has been stable because after the fact during theperiod of changing circumstances the definitions of the Ms have beenchanged to take account of changes in composition and so forth. So,they are sort of stable retroactively. With that background, Ibelieve we're overstating our ignorance because I think we do know alot about what has been happening to M2. Maybe we should be focusingmore on that and perhaps less on the ranges. For example, if weadjust M2 over the past few months to what has been happening to stockand bond funds and perhaps RTC activity, I believe that we can makethe case that M2, properly defined to take that into account, has beenpretty much in the middle of our target ranges.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, but then unfortunately the troubleis that if we carry that definition consistently back, it ceases tohave the earlier robust relationship with nominal gross nationalproduct. I'm not sure that the changing definitions have created thatmuch of an alteration in history. My recollection is that even thoughthe definition of M2 has changed materially over time, it has alwaysbeen stable back to the turn of century.MR. MCTEER. I think it's the case with M2 and Ml, though,that it's much more stable after the revisions backward.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I will not deny that.MR. MCTEER. I think we would have---57-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The reason you can assume that is thatwe would not have published if it were less stable!MR. MCTEER. In any case, I would hate for us to overstateour ignorance and have that be interpreted as our not having a clue asto what is going on. I think we know pretty much what is going on.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What we will do essentially is toindicate very much what the staff study suggests, which is a veryclever insight into a number of issues, and say what pieces ofinformation remain to be understood prior to our coming out with ananswer. I think that's actually what we're doing. Any othercomments?I'd like to have separate votes on this since there may bedifferences. I would like to propose alternative I with thestipulation that for 1992 [we will retain the current ranges]. Youhave the language that goes with it. Don, would you give us yourrecommendation on the language here?MR. KOHN. Just on 1992, assuming the Committee votes toretain the 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range, the staff had put in asentence, shown at the bottom of page 21 and the top of page 22 of theBluebook, that the Committee might want to consider if it wanted tosay that velocity increases might persist and that it recognized that[money] growth could be low. As I read this in the full light of theFOMC meeting, my recommendation is that, given the uncertainty, Iwouldn't use the second half of this sentence saying that M2 and M3could come in around the lower end of the ranges; we just really don'tknow. So, I think there are really two alternatives. One is to say:"In evaluating the aggregates, the Committee anticipated thatdevelopments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persistin the second half of the year" or something like that so at least youconvey some sense that something unusual is going on. While you weretalking I was writing something else similar to that: "In evaluatingthe growth of the aggregates relative to the ranges, the Committeerecognized the unusual behavior of velocity apparently in train thisyear" or something along those lines. So, I would recommend againstthe second half of the suggested sentence. But the Committee mightwant to say something like the first half of the sentence in thedirective. Obviously, this will be said in the Humphrey-Hawkinsreport, so it's not as if we wouldn't be communicating with thepublic. But you could say something in the directive aboutanticipating unusual velocity behavior this year.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The Humphrey-Hawkins report will bepublished before this is published.MR. KOHN. Right.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, this is really a moot question?MR. KOHN. Sure. It's just a question of completeness of therecord.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.MR. KOHN. It's not important.-58-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The first [part of the] sentence I thinkprobably makes sense and I'd leave it at that.MR. ANGELL. The first half?MR. KOHN. Just the first half of the sentence. Okay, so itwould say: "The Committee anticipated that developments contributingto unusual velocity increases could persist in the second half of theyear."CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Period.MR. BERNARD. This will be a vote on the 1992 ranges. Thefirst sentence on the general objectives would stay the same and thencontinuing: "In furtherance of these objectives, the Committeereaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in Februaryfor growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent,respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourthquarter of 1992. The Committee anticipated that developmentscontributing to unusual velocity increases could persist in the secondhalf of the year." And then to pick up on nonfinancial debt, aboutthe middle of page 22: "The monitoring range for growth of totaldomestic nonfinancial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2percent for the year."Chairman Greenspan YesVice Chairman Corrigan YesGovernor Angell YesPresident Hoenig YesPresident Jordan YesGovernor Kelley YesGovernor LaWare YesGovernor Lindsey YesPresident Melzer YesGovernor Mullins YesGovernor Phillips YesPresident Syron YesCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay.MR. ANGELL. Congratulations, Mr. ChairmanCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Wait a minute.MR. BERNARD. And then for 1993 beginning about two-thirds orso the way down on page 22: "For 1993, the Committee agreed ontentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarterof 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993, of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent forM2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set theassociated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debtat 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent. The behavior of the monetary aggregateswill continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward pricelevel stability, movements in their velocities, and developments inthe economy and financial markets."MR. SYRON. May I ask a question just on the language? I'msympathetic to the suggestion, but the concern about velocity alsoapplies to what we're talking about for the '93 ranges. So, I'm-59-6/30-7/1/92wondering if it would be better just to say that unusual velocitycould persist, period, rather than to say it could persist in thesecond half of the year. If it was thought that that sentence wouldapply also to the '93 targets, that might be better because otherwisewe don't have something that explicitly says that.MR. KOHN. We do. The last sentence says: "The behavior ofthe monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light ofprogress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities,and developments in the economy and financial markets."MR. SYRON. I saw that, but the earlier sentence that refersto '92 is a little more explicit.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, the trouble is it creates the typeof problem that Governor LaWare is concerned about. It makes too muchof a "know-nothing" [unintelligible].MR. SYRON. I understand that argument and I don't want tosay that we don't know anything; but I think there is a difference inbeing able to say that the world has evolved and that our body ofknowledge and ability to interpret--our internal computer, so tospeak--hasn't diminished in terms of our effectiveness. But it's thisexternal environment; it may be a subtle point and it may not bepossible [to convey it]. I happen to think that's what the situationis, that our internal capacity to evaluate these things probably isgreater because of the experience than it has been in the past butthat the external environment is more difficult.MR. KOHN. The sentence refers to velocity "increases," so Idon't know whether the Committee wants to make that statement aboutnext year particularly [unintelligible] ranges. I think it recognizesthe fact that growth is coming in at under 2 percent, Q4 to June.MR. SYRON. It was a suggestion and I withdraw it. But Ican't withdraw a question! [Laughter]MR. ANGELL. Don, is there any alternative language to "TheCommittee agreed on tentative ranges"? It seems to me that what we'resaying here is something a little different than "agreed" on tentativeranges. I think what we've agreed to do is quite different; we arereally saying that we are deferring a decision to change the range.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Can we say "The Committee tentativelyplaced" or something like that?MR. ANGELL. Yes, any change in the wording would be helpful.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think you're right that the word"agreed" is not the right word.MR. LAWARE. "Tentatively established"?MR. ANGELL. "Established" is tough.MR. PRELL. The statute in force requires language close tothis. I think it requires you to "establish"---60-6/30-7/1/92MR. KOHN. "Plans and objectives."MR. PRELL. Yes, "plans and objectives." And one time wetried not to, though that was more extreme--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, this will be a minor issue becauseit will be published after the Humphrey-Hawkins report and we'llhandle that in that respect.MR. LAWARE. Why not just say the Committee "set" tentativeranges?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's a good idea.MR. ANGELL. Yes, "set" is better.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That's much better.MR. ANGELL. Well, "plucked" might be even better!CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think "set" solves the problem.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Right.MR. ANGELL. Thank you.MR. BERNARD. Change "set" to "established" in the othersentence?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, sure.MR. BERNARD.Chairman Greenspan YesVice Chairman Corrigan YesGovernor Angell YesPresident Hoenig YesPresident Jordan NoGovernor Kelley YesGovernor LaWare YesGovernor Lindsey YesPresident Melzer YesGovernor Mullins YesGovernor Phillips NoPresident Syron YesCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, let's now break for coffee.[Coffee break]MR. KOHN. A number of members yesterday gave the reasonsI'd already written down for why the Committee might want to chooseone of the other courses for the intermeeting period and I won'trepeat them. I do have a few background points, though, to bring tothe attention of the Committee as you make your decision on short-runpolicy. First, I can bring you up to date on the monetary aggregates;we do have some new information this morning and it suggests a furtherweakening in money growth and credit. The revisions are exclusivelyin the Ml category. [Statement--see Appendix.]-61-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Mr. Kohn?MR. ANGELL. Don, M1 growth from Q4 to June would be what?MR. KOHN. Well, Governor Angell, I don't have that answerfor the new Ml, incorporating the latest revisions. I guess I'dsubtract about 1/4 or 1/3 of a percentage point; growth from Q4 toJune before was 12-1/4 percent so my guess would be 12 percent or alittle under that.MR. ANGELL. So it's approximately 12 percent--well withindouble-digits then?MR. KOHN. Yes.MR. ANGELL. And the 3-month growth rate of Ml?MR. KOHN. Well, it was 6 percent and now it would be 5percent approximately.MR. ANGELL. Thank you.MR. SYRON. Don, what is your early look at next week?MR. KOHN. For the week to be published Ml would be aboutflat and M2 and M3 would decline by about $3-1/2 billion and $9billion respectively. I hasten to add that these are very preliminarydata subject to substantial revisions.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.MR. MCTEER. Don, do you think the prime rate would respondto a 1/4 point cut in the fed funds rate?MR. KOHN. I think it's highly likely. The banks didn'trespond last time; I think another cut would put pressure on them. Isuppose they might try to resist, especially if there weren't adiscount rate cut at the same time. It would be a nice test ofwhether there is any aggressiveness out there in seeking loans.MR. MCTEER. Do you have an educated guess about Juneemployment numbers?MR. KOHN. No.MR. PARRY. Do you have a guess?MR. KOHN. Mike has a guess.MR. BLACK. Uneducated?MR. PRELL. Our guess was 80,000. Just to bring you up todate, for those who don't have telerate screens today, the NationalAssociation of Purchasing Managers came out with a report thismorning. The overall index was down [from] 56 and a fraction to 52and a fraction. Construction put-in-place data for May came out; theywere a little hard to read because they involved revised seasonalfactors, but a quick look suggests that the numbers going from the-62-6/30-7/1/92first to the second quarter were considerably stronger than we hadanticipated, particularly in the state and local sector. So,offsetting some of the disappointment there--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We finally got a number that's higherthan expected!MR. PRELL. This state and local number is phenomenal; it'srunning very strong.MR. BLACK. Was the private nonresidential unchanged?MR. PRELL. Well, that's what is a little hard to read. Itdoes not appear to be a drastic change from our expectation.MR. ANGELL. Does that modify your real GDP for the secondquarter?MR. PRELL. Well, I think it helps it to stay in the 2percent area.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions for Don?MR. STERN. At the last meeting were we looking for 2-1/2percent M2 growth for the second quarter or something like that?MR. KOHN. We were looking particularly for about 1-1/2percent in May and 3-1/2 percent in June, which we didn't get.MR. STERN. Did you run a simulation or anything with theexperimental model for the second quarter?MR. KOHN. Not for the second quarter, or at least if we did,I'm not aware of it. Dave Lindsey, are you aware of anything? Ididn't ask anyone for it.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions? Jerry.MR. JORDAN. With the advantage of whatever hindsight thereis in the last few months, if you felt very strongly about 1-1/2percent for growth of an aggregate in the second quarter--and it wastalked about a couple of months back--would an experimental model havesuggested that if there had been a sufficient cutting of the fundsrate it would have produced that kind of growth? And would we knowabout which components of M3 are going down [unintelligible]?MR. KOHN. I wouldn't know exactly what the ceteris paribusis there, but I think probably not. That is, the interestelasticities in those models, while still of the appropriate sign,assume that long rates react a little with short rates since there's alot of yield curve [unintelligible]. [If] long rates go the wrong wayor don't move at all, then the interest elasticities go essentially tozero or even turn around. But assuming long rates came out as theydid over the second quarter, it would have taken a very largereduction in short-term interest rates--I don't know the number--tohave gotten M2 growth into the 2 to 3 percent area over the quarter.-63-6/30-7/1/92MR. JORDAN. It seems to me that there are only two wayswe're going to get stronger M2 growth: If there is either a pickup inloan demand and banks bid more aggressively so that the yield curve ontheir liabilities shifts with the offering rate on time certificatesversus regular savings and so forth; or if the banking industrydecides to drop sharply the zero maturity deals. At some point therewill be yields between zero maturity liabilities from checkables andregular savings and money market deposit accounts, versus timecertificates [that] compete with other nonbank liabilities.MR. KOHN. I think dropping the zero maturity yields isn'tgoing to help M2 growth. In fact, that's basically the story we'retelling for the rise in velocity in the second half of this year andinto next year: That those zero maturity yields along with theeffects of the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) will be dropping offeringrates. And while some of that will just keep money [in] time depositsto some extent, people with savings-type money in NOW accounts will belooking elsewhere to put that money outside of M2. So, I don't thinkdropping those rates will help.MR. JORDAN. If balances shift from reservable liabilities tonon-reserveable liabilities, we're going to see either a contractionin bank reserves--Desk operations will be absorbing reserves--or abuild-up, temporarily at least, in excess reserves. And the bankingindustry is going to be working to try to get rid of those excessreserves.MR. KOHN. Right, and the federal funds rate would be undertremendous downward pressure.MR. JORDAN. Exactly.MR. KOHN. Right. And so as long as the Committee sets thefederal funds rate with an instruction to Ms. Lovett to hit it, thereserves could contract under that situation. If the Committee wereto choose to target a reserve level and that happened, then I thinkthe federal funds rate would drop very substantially in the short run.MR. JORDAN. So, we'd have a situation where bank reservesare going down with a constant funds rate and the interpretation wouldbe that policy is unchanged while bank reserves are contracting?MR. KOHN. That depends on how one measures policy.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anything further? If not, let me getstarted on the discussion. I've puzzled about the fact that we as agroup have a fairly general, consistent notion as to how the economyworks and where we'd like it to be, and yet in yesterday's discussionit was fairly clear that there was a very significant difference amongvarious [speakers]. I asked myself what is causing that to see if wecan get a firm view as to how the system is working. As best I canjudge, it all really started with Jerry Corrigan and others raisingthe point that if somebody wanted to certify the outcome in theGreenbook, we'd all say "Hurrah, that's perfect" and we'd sign off onit right now. I'm not aware of any of us who would argue strenuouslythat the outcome in the Greenbook is substantially inappropriate andthat if it came out that way we would be anything but pleased. The-64-6/30-7/1/92question really gets down to the notion of what could prevent thatfrom happening.While there were some comments--not a great number but enoughto raise an issue--that the economy could conceivably turn out to bemuch stronger than the outlook in the Greenbook, the substantialconcern was that it would fall short. That is, most of you who are inthis camp suggested that the risks are on the down side, implying thatin some way the economic system would falter. I think we have to askourselves why. What is it about the system that we are now observingthat would have that particular characteristic? If we take theGreenbook forecast, we have a standard, old-fashioned economicforecast with old economic relationships, as Mike Prell put it. MaybeI shouldn't put words in his mouth! He'll come back at me and tell mehe was misquoted! [Laughter] I'll [ascribe that description] tomyself. We are having a significant expansion in operating profitmargins, cash flow in the corporate sector is improving, and we arebeginning to see it in the capital goods markets. History tells usthat that process will feed in through the increased incomes andemployment that a number of people are looking for. A conventionalexpansion of the type that is in a sense expressed in the Greenbook,or even something slightly higher, would be the normal expectedoutcome. That is what that view of the world exemplifies. Were thatin fact the case, it's pretty obvious at this stage that where we arewith monetary policy is probably where we ought to stay because thereis no obvious need to move [rates] lower; in fact one can argue thatit may be counterproductive in that context for us to move lower.There is, however, the other model which is evolving overtime, which I would hate to be required to put into structural formand try to estimate its parameters. In fact, I'd even prefer not toput it down in writing because it might get too clear! I'm not beingfacetious. There is a sense that what we're looking at really gets to[such] a set of relationships here. Let me try it out and see where Iget because I think it would explain what the phenomenon is and wouldsuggest to us what to look for to test whether the hypothesis isworking. I start with something we've discussed before: namely, toexplain the nature of the balance sheet restraint that resulted from asignificant rise in assets during the 1980s, funded by debt, and asubsequent decline in market values of assets which created balancesheet impairment. The balance sheet impairment [leads] individualsand businesses to move their cash flow from the purchase of goods andservices and investment goods toward debt reduction or other balancesheet repairs, essentially shifting the consumption function in amanner to generate a much higher saving rate and basically a pullingback on investment incentives in the business sector. Now, that is aphenomenon we have seen many times in the past--it's called [thepanics of] 1873, 1893, 1907.... It's the classic balance sheet/marketvalue crunch which induces a very significant liquidity freeze-up inthe banking system and induces a tremendous shift of cash flow towardsavings rather than to the purchase of goods and services. And youget the classic Keynesian contraction at that time.It strikes me that what we effectively have been doing since1989, I hope more consciously than otherwise, is to take the sameadjustment process--which in the 19th century would have meant thatthe economy would have gone down sharply, the balance sheets wouldhave been repaired reasonably quickly, and [the economy] would have-65-6/30-7/1/92come back the usual way--and by injecting significant and continuousamounts of liquidity into the system, we in effect have prevented theliquidity freeze-up and have stretched out the adjustment process.The question, of course, is whether there is more adjustment that hasto be done this way or less. Or do we know? I suspect that at thispoint we don't really know. But I do think this explains, or canexplain, what basically has been happening in the last two years.When we continue to inject liquidity in the system, the adjustmentprocess takes place; and when we stop injecting liquidity, after awhile the economy begins to show symptoms of weakness again. That isanother way of saying that the unmedicated economy goes back to theway it used to behave in the 19th century and it begins to get the[liquidity] freeze-up until we re-inject even small amounts ofliquidity and the adjustment process continues. That, I believe, canexplain the Christmas effect that we had. I think it explains theApril injection. And the question that one has to ask is: If this isin fact the case, how long will it go on and what will happen if westop moving toward supplying liquidity when a normal adjustmentprocess is in fact to squeeze up the process and to tilt the economytoward a sharply increased propensity to save rather than to consumeand go into investment goods?If what we are seeing now is an indication that we haven'tdone enough and that the last injection has petered out, thenpresumably we will see some weakness in activity, which is verydifficult to explain in the context of our standard models. In otherwords, it is very difficult in my judgment to take our standardmodels--to take the income flows that are moving the profit flows--andargue other than [that we will see] an increase in activity albeitmodest. So, the key test of which of the models is basically workingrequires an evaluation of the short-term phenomena. And the reasonwhy in Jerry Jordan's terms we are somewhat concerned about the turnin all of the monetary aggregates and the low level of nonfinancialdebt creation, which incidently would be obviously explained by thisprocess, is that one would presume that if we are dealing with a sortof implosion propensity, we may see it in very modest financialintermediation and presumably also in a significant softness in loandemand, which is basically what we have.So, if this does explain the phenomena--and let's assume thatwe now have done enough and that the data for the most recent weeksare phony and the economy is coming back--it does raise an interestingquestion on the other side of this whole process. Because if we hadbeen injecting significant amounts of liquidity in the system--and atthe moment I leave what I mean by that somewhat undefined--it wouldfollow that.when the balance sheet adjustment is complete, the levelof liquidity would be too high and we would then be required to pullback in the growth [of money] as the economy begins to [gain strength]and as the cash flow, which has been drawn off at least in part intosavings flows, starts to shift its proportions to a more normal .95 inpersonal consumption and a much higher response in the capital goodsmarkets. I might say that the argument statistically, which raisessome question about this hypothesis, is that it is difficult to find asignificant rise in the saving rate. Granted, I'm only looking expost; the argument that I'm making is ex ante. Nonetheless, if therewere a significant rise in the saving rate, that would very stronglysuggest that this is a model that is functioning.-66-6/30-7/1/92Now, it may well be, as we have discussed at other times,that the personal saving rate is indeed actually higher than we aremeasuring it on the grounds that the statistical discrepancy may bereflecting a shortfall in wages and salaries or personal income. Andthat particular shortfall would be consistent with the fact thathousehold employment data are actually much stronger than the payrolldata; indeed, some analyses by the staff suggest that the nextrevision of the payroll data will be up. That might suggest, sincepersonal consumption expenditures have not changed in this process,that raising income will put it all into savings. So, it may well bethat looking back at this period after the fact we will indeed seewhat is seemingly the missing ingredient in this model: That we havea somewhat higher level ex post of savings than we [currently] seem tobe getting. In any event, what all of this suggests is that thetesting of these two models as to what is happening is essentiallywhat we are seeing at this particular stage.My own impression is that having eased 22 times so far [sinceMay 1989]--is that what it is Don?--which has to be some sort ofrecord, we have to be getting close to the point where this adjustmentprocess is beginning to come to an end. I would suspect that at thepoint it does come to an end this economy could all of a sudden showsome significant vibrancy. But, obviously, we don't have to go allthe way because if, for example, the proportion of expenditures out ofcash flow is rising, though it remains subnormal, the rate of growthin the economy will pick up, although less than its potential. So, Ithink it would be helpful to look not only at the economy directly butto a great extent at what is happening in the financial system for anindication as to what is going on. Having come through all of this, Iwould conclude that we have to watch very especially the nature ofwhat is going on in the economy. I would suspect that were we tochoose to move, say, 25 basis points and got a prime rate cut, weprobably would get 50 basis points; and if this process of liquidityfreezing up is what is occurring, then clearly that would be helpfulat that particular time. I don't feel overly comfortable, frankly,with either of these two models at this stage. But I think they docapture, as best one can, the prevailing possibilities--the majorprobabilities--of where this economy is going. We're undoubtedlygoing to learn a good deal more in the next couple of weeks as to howthis is all evolving.I conclude by saying that, after listening to the generalviews regarding what this Committee is concerned about and adding upthe number of people on the Committee who have taken different views,I am led, as I try to find the central tendency, to [propose] a mildlyasymmetric directive toward ease but with the requirement that beforeany action is taken there be a telephone conference to explain why.I'm not sure that captures everybody; I suspect it probably does not.But having thought about trying to find where the central tendency is--where one captures the largest number of views and concerns of thisCommittee--that's pretty much where I come out. Actually, I findmyself comfortable in that position, and I would like to raise it as apossible means by which we can resolve what is clearly a differing setof concerns about the immediate outlook that this Committee expressedin some detail yesterday. President Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman having been in the uncomfortableposition of supporting you [earlier] only 95 percent in my estimation,-67-6/30-7/1/92I would like to express 100 percent agreement with this approach. Iwould add only thing: I think we ought to include the bracketedsentence on page 23 of the Bluebook which stresses the uncertainty.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, I agree.MR. BLACK. So, it's 100 percent agreement, not 98!CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry.MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, I originally came with anexpectation of recommending no change and a symmetric directive, butit became clear to me in the discussion yesterday that the weaknesswas not in the Twelfth District, so I certainly could accept yourrecommendation.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, as I said yesterday, I havesomewhat less confidence than I had in May that the recovery is on asustainable path. But having said that, I don't think there's anysubstantial evidence that the economy is going into the tank in anysense. So, while there's a case to be made for some easing, I don'tthink that's the more persuasive argument at the moment and I wouldprefer to maintain our present policy and await further developments.And I think there's no particular harm in having an asymmetricdirective, so I accept your proposal.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Keehn.MR. KEEHN. Mr. Chairman, given my comments yesterday, I'dfavor alternative A and an easing move now, but I could acceptalternative B with asymmetric language. Without necessarily meaningto put you on the spot, what kind of timing [are you contemplating]and what kinds of things might prompt the calling of a telephoneconference?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would say a fairly broad sense ofcumulative weakness beyond where we are now. It's hard for me to bespecific; there are so many different interests. I think we all knowwhat the key elements are. But an evident break in the pattern ofwhat we're seeing now would have to show up. I doubt if I can be anymore specific than that. Let me say, for example, that if auto salesall of a sudden die, frankly, that would worry me because that hasbeen one of the [unintelligible].MR. KEEHN. You mean autos, employment, a series of thingslike that?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Plus let me say that even though we haveargued strenuously about various monetary aggregates, that is not thesame thing as saying that they are utterly irrelevant. Obviously, ifwe're getting evidence that loan demand is continuing to fall and themonetary aggregates are starting down in the context of otherweakness, we should not disregard the financial measures even thoughthere have been significant problems with them. At the margin, theyare probably telling us something.-68-6/30-7/1/92MR. KEEHN. Just the same, my view is that we have reached apoint where some additional easing would be called for now; therefore,I would have a preference for "A." But the way that you phrased "B"with asymmetric language [toward ease] would be acceptable.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor LaWare.MR. LAWARE. Mr. Chairman, for all the reasons I citedyesterday in my references to Pavlov and his dog and so forth, I wouldprefer "B" but I strongly prefer symmetric language.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Melzer.MR. MELZER. I come out the same place, Alan. I feel thatsymmetry is an important issue. At the last meeting we in effectcommunicated to the public--probably earlier than intended though itshould be communicated this Friday--the fact that our having moved tosymmetric language at that time was quite significant. And to moveback to asymmetry toward ease would communicate the wrong [message]about how we ought to approach this process. There's no questionabout it: There's a lot of uncertainty now. But I don't think we canlet ourselves get whipped around by these changing expectations thesame way speculators in financial markets do. We have to take a muchlonger view and we have to be willing to look through one month or twomonths; we have to be looking at quarterly or longer numbers. So, ina sense the message we're sending here is a very confusing one andprobably a much more significant one than anything we might do withlong-run ranges. It gets back to the issue of: "Look at what we doand not what we say," but this is something that we say that's muchmore significant, I think, than the long-term ranges.The reason I come out where I do is that first of all, Ithink we have an expansion in place somewhere around the economy'spotential. I think at a minimum monetary policy is consistent withthat expansion process. In other words, I don't have the sense thatthe economy is being choked by any means on the liquidity front. Asthe expansion progresses and it comes through in a number of ways--youjust said it yourself in your comments and I think it's implicit insome things in the Bluebook--we're going to have to be going in theother direction. And to be thinking about additional ease now makesthat next job that much tougher. Again, I don't want to flip-flop.It's really in the context of where we were last time. In general,thinking along those lines at this stage has some importantcredibility effects which could be reflected in long markets and inthe foreign exchange market. I don't really put much credence indeclines in longer-term yields that are supposedly associated withexpectations of ease. I think what tends to happen is that when thatsense develops, speculators [find] that a very effective vehicle inwhich to speculate. That's where one gets the most bang for the buck.The speculators get in there; they may drive yields down temporarilybut in the event you could have a lot of sellers [who are] verydisappointed. So, I take heart in the fact that whateverdisappointment was reflected in our moving to asymmetry last timewashed out fairly quickly and long-term yields worked their way down.Obviously, they may have come down a little further on some of thisspeculative behavior I'm describing, but I think that's how we'regoing to make our contribution. We took a stand last time and I thinkthis is the time to stay with it.-69-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. Well, I think we're at or near a point wherewe're going to have to ease, and asymmetry is broadly consistent withthat. I'm sure all of us wish we had some stable beacon way off outthere in the fog that we could latch onto and [unintelligible], butthe fact is that there isn't that kind of beacon. While we may not bevery happy that we have to look at these current economic indicators,in fact that's all there is right now that we can look at. And if theeconomy begins to weaken again, which I think already has started, itprobably will need another shot of liquidity. We ought not fightthat; we ought to accept it and move with it and do the best we can.I would not wait all that long. I don't think we need a whole lot ofevidence piled on top of what we have to reach the point for easing.Also, if we get to that point, I wouldn't automatically think in termsof just a quarter point on the funds rate. A quarter point may bringdown the prime rate but it may not. I don't think we need anotherpresent [such as the one] we gave the economy last December, but wecould very well think in terms of 1/2 point on the discount rate andsomething comparable to that on the funds rate. So, I think we'relooking at an easing move, and I suspect we'll have one before we sitaround this table again.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Angell.MR. ANGELL. In some ways it seems strange, I suppose, to beconfident at times such as these, but I ask myself what we need to doto have long bond rates lower by September 1 and I am very, veryconfident that [the answer] is for us to do as you suggest and that isto stand pat. I believe that the Federal Reserve does control long-run bond prices; it's much tougher than [controlling] the fed fundsrate, but if we're going to control long bond prices, we have to do itby focusing on that [rate]. The uncertainty inflation premium is verydisruptive to economic growth. I'm also confident that economicgrowth will be stronger if we stand pat and if we give the world asense that we are indeed an independent central bank that has its eyeupon the one thing we can do and that is to create an environment ofprice stability. That adds not only to long-run growth but I believeit adds to short-run growth in this environment. I understand thatthe Humphrey-Hawkins testimony has been pretty well determined, andI'm thinking about how our commitment to price level stability wouldcome out if before that [testimony] or at that time [we were to ease]We know that's not what is our guide, but the world will see it as acapitulation. It seems to me it would undermine that testimony that Iunderstood you wanted to be there as a substitute for lowering themonetary aggregates growth ranges.Now, like John LaWare and Tom Melzer, I strongly prefersymmetric language because that really is standing pat. I wonder,with the attention on symmetry that took place last time, whether wewill get through the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony without this beingknown. It seems to me that even going from symmetry back to asymmetrysends a signal of uncertainty that the market doesn't need. So, Istrongly prefer symmetric language. I heard what you said in regardto the way you're going to make your choices and I didn't hearanything about M2 being the guiding factor in that. So, in a sense,I'm very supportive of what you're saying, but I'm very concerned-70-6/30-7/1/92about being in the same voting group with others who certainly want toease quickly.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern.MR. STERN. I, too, would prefer a symmetric directive atthis point mainly because I think we shouldn't be in too big a hurryto take any action in the near term and should be prepared to assess arange of incoming data. I don't know which of your two models may bemore appropriate in the current setting. It seems to me that anotherway to describe what is going on--in terms of a sluggish recovery,small gains in employment, small gains in spending, balance sheetrestructuring, and all that--is that it's part of the price that hasto be paid to bring down the rate of inflation. Perhaps if ourcredibility were higher, the price would be lower and we wouldn't haveto endure some of this and we would see incoming numbers perhaps moreto our intuitive liking. But I've become convinced, unfortunately,that our credibility really isn't all that high and that a period likethis is probably what we have to endure to make progress on that side.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Phillips.MS. PHILLIPS. I would prefer to ease to accommodate therestructuring, but I could live with an asymmetric directive.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley.MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, I support "B" and I would stronglyprefer symmetric language; I identify myself with President Melzer andGovernor Angell among others and their comments. But I would not vote"no" on an asymmetric directive because I do share your concern andothers' concerns that [the economy] could possibly be falteringseriously here, although I very much doubt that. If it became clear--and I do mean clear, at the risk of being what some would call toolate--that we were having a seriously faltering economy, then I couldsupport an easing. Consequently, I would not vote against anasymmetric directive.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. This is a tough one. I guess theway I try to approach a lot of this financial confusion is that in mymind's eye I can conceivably see three profiles of the economy overthe next several quarters. Each looks to me as if it has profoundlydifferent implications. It is possible, although I think it's only a10 percent probability, that we could have a 3-1/2 percent [growth]profile. If that turned out to be the case, the policy response tothat is pretty easy: We'd have to start tightening. Then there isthe 2-1/2 percent economy, an economy that as I said yesterday isquite consistent with the price stability goal based on Chart 17. Ido think that that's the likely outcome. I would still put a 50percent probability on that. And the policy response to that is alsoeasy: We'd just sit where we are. But then there's the thirdscenario, the 1-1/2 percent profile, which in my mental processescarries with it something like a 40 percent probability. Now, that'sthe tough nut, because I personally believe, in the broadest possiblecontext of public policy, that that outcome is unacceptable. Also, ifwe find ourselves in that profile after the fact and we're left in a-71-6/30-7/1/92position in which we were trying to adjust policy after the fact, Ithink we'd have a helluva problem on our hands. Because I think thereis not an inconsequential probability of that kind of outcome, I wouldrather squarely associate myself with an asymmetric directive.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Syron.MR. SYRON. Mr. Chairman, this obviously is as tough asituation for deciding what to do in the immediate situation, [aswe've had] in some substantial period of time. But I must say that,for my own reasons, I find myself having views that are very similarto Jerry Corrigan's. In looking at the reasons, I find myself quiteattracted to the second model as compared to the conventional model,in terms of what is happening with the economy. A part of that islooking at the serial optimism that has been in my own forecast basedon the conventional model going back for some time and looking at theoptimism that has been in all of our forecasts on a conditional basis.I am aware of the concerns that if the second model is [true] it meansthat inevitably we are overshooting and putting in too much liquidity,but I think we can sop that up afterwards. And what that tells me isthat we need a more activist policy in terms of not being so concernedabout relatively small movements in the funds rate. Though I think wecome at this from somewhat different analytical schools, I amattracted to some of the questions that Jerry Jordan raised aboutcredibility in the sense that if we said we're going to do somethingon the Ms but we're not doing it. I don't like the excuse that we wereunwilling to move the funds rate to [achieve that]. Also, looking atwhat we might do right now, I do think that a move in the prime ratewould be beneficial for the economy as a whole; I don't have a lot ofconcern that we'd see too much stimulus out of that, and I think we'dget [a prime rate cut if we eased]. To tell you the truth, in theabsence of the jawboning that we've had from the Administration--if weweren't in such an awkward position--I would generally prefer to dosomething at this meeting. I have to disagree with Ed a little inthat under ordinary circumstances I would have preferred [a cut of] 25basis points at the meeting today. But in the environment we're in,with this amount of jawboning, I'd be cautious about pushing too hardfor that. Where all of this leads me, to go back to Bob Black'sanalogy, is that I'm 60/40 in favor of what you're doing but that'sheavily weighted by the notion that I think we should be asymmetrictoward ease. And the indication that you've given that we would havea conference call to deal with that assuages my own concerns that weshould generally [act] at meetings or when there is full Committeeconsultation.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan.MR. JORDAN. I took your reference to 22 moves to be cuts inthe funds rate over a period of time and then you made a reference to[that] coming to an end. If we're still on a track toward at least alower inflation environment if not stable prices, measured somehow,then it shouldn't be the end of the moves because 3-3/4 percent isstill too high whether one thinks in terms of real rates or[unintelligible]. The one reason that might be given for either goingback to an asymmetric directive or to cut the funds rate now or in thefuture that I would oppose is weakness in the economy. If we're goingto do something, that's the wrong reason to do it because itreinforces the idea that we try to fine-tune policy actions to-72-6/30-7/1/92influence things we can't influence. Whatever uncertainty we haveabout the aggregates, I have more confidence in their giving us andthe public at large information about the long run [unintelligible]--where it's going to be next year and the year after--than the latestnumbers produced by the Commerce Department or the BLS or thepurchasing managers or realtors or any other particular group. Wehave a lot of uncertainty about those numbers [as well as] atremendous amount of uncertainty [about] M2, but we can signal that wehave more confidence in the [money] numbers by changing the funds ratebased on them. Not doing it based on the Ms, I think, is not helpfulto our longer-run case in terms of credibility.I'm in a difficult position because we are below target on M2and the decision has now been made not to lower the range for thisyear or next year. To be consistent then, given the model that we usefor influencing the aggregates, we should be lowering the funds ratein order to show how serious we are about coming in at least at thebottom end of the range. That's so we will be credible when we saythat the opposite is also true--that when we're at the top end of therange we're not going to hesitate then either. So, failure to cut thefunds rate, given what is going on in the markets today, is in my minda relative tightening policy action compared to the market, and Idon't see any basis for that. Reserves are falling and all of theaggregates [are weak], and I think that's something we should not bewilling to tolerate. But at the same time I would resist cutting thefunds rate on a signal of weak economic activity. I'd like to do ittoday, but I wanted to do it today coupled with an announcement thatwe cut the target ranges for the long run at the same time we cut thefunds rate and then let the analysts figure out whether we tightenedor eased.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.MR. HOENIG. As I look at the discussion that we've had andyour models, I prefer your second model as well. I think it issuggesting that we still have an environment in the economy generallyof great uncertainty and the building of liquidity. And in thatcontext staying where we are is, as Jerry stated, a tightening. Inaddition, it's not just the money numbers but other financialinformation and the financial environment that suggest that we couldand should ease. My strong preference, then, would be to ease now;however, I can live with an asymmetric directive. It's consistentwith where I was at least last time. And if the information comes in,given the way you answered President Keehn, I can live with that.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer.MR. MCTEER. If we're not going to decide to ease today, thenI would support your recommendation for "B" but with a symmetricdirective. It may become necessary to ease a little later and if soit can be done with a symmetric directive. But if it's not necessaryto ease later and we don't end up easing, I think symmetric languagein the record would serve us better than asymmetric language.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Lindsey.MR. LINDSEY. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate yourefforts to find a consensus. What has struck me about the challenge-73-6/30-7/1/92to the independence of the Federal Reserve is a need for us to speakwith one voice as much as possible. Frankly, I find myself tornbetween your recommendation, which I will support, and PresidentJordan's recommendation which I also could support were he chairman![Laughter] The reason I think his argument is compelling and I thinkyour argument is compelling is that I believe both will end upiterating in the same direction. But we face tremendousuncertainties, tremendous challenges, both in the economic arena andin the political arena. And I would hope that your search for aconsensus would produce one in this Committee because I do realizethat the challenges you personally have ahead of you in the next monthare great.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Mullins.MR. MULLINS. We have an environment with both weakness inthe aggregates, which we've seen for some time, and the risk ofweakness in the real economy. So, I think "B" asymmetric toward easeis appropriate.MR. BLACK. I'm not sure I'd say the same thing if I werespeaking again. I supported the Chairman but then on furtherreflection I thought that if we had lowered the targets for next yearI would support him more enthusiastically, if I may put it that way.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I am proposing a vote for a mildlyasymmetric directive; that's alternative B with the presumption of atelephone conference prior to any move that might be initiated underthat directive. Do you want to read the language?MR. BERNARD. [Does the Committee wish to use the additionalsentence proposed in the Bluebook, which reads]: "However, the recentunusual behavior of these aggregates suggests that the relationshipbetween their growth and the Committee's long-run objectives isespecially uncertain at this time."MR. LAWARE. Do we want to say "especially uncertain at thistime?"SPEAKER(?). I don't like that "especially."MR. SYRON. Governor LaWare has a point. "Uncertain" isuncertain enough!MR. BLACK. We can say "slightly" or "somewhat."MR. SYRON. "Could" be uncertain or "would" be uncertain.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do we really need that sentence in hereat this time?MR. MULLINS. We've already got it regarding the '92 range.MR. ANGELL. I think we need the sentence in, but I'd take"especially" out.-74-6/30-7/1/92CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What's the view on that? Should we take"especially" out or keep it in? How many people feel "especially"would be better?MR. SYRON. Please.MR. LAWARE. I don't like the sentence.SPEAKER(?). I don't like the sentence either.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don't we do this; why don't we havethe whole thing read and let's see what it sounds like.MR. ANGELL. With "especially" out.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. With "especially" out in the reading.MR. BERNARD. "In the implementation of policy for theimmediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degreeof pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee'slong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economicgrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, andmonetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might orslightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in theintermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expectedto be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 in the period from Junethrough September at annual rates of about 2 and 1/2 percent,respectively. However, the recent unusual behavior of theseaggregates suggests that the relationship between their growth and theCommittee's long-run objectives is uncertain at this time."SPEAKER(?). Sounds bad.MR. ANGELL. If we take the sentence out, how can we livewith the 2 percent and the 1/2 percent?SPEAKER(?). That's the problem.MR. ANGELL. What do we have besides 2 percent and 1/2percent? What is a better number than 2? If we say "about" and wewant to be symmetric around it what number would you choose, Don?MR. KOHN. Well, let's see. Do you want a whole number?MR. ANGELL. No, I don't--MR. KOHN. We gave you our best guess, i.e., 2 percent.MR. ANGELL. 2 percent.MR. LINDSEY. It's 2 percent for M2 and 1/2 percent for M3;that's what 2 and 1/2 mean; there are two lines.MR. ANGELL. Oh, I see--2, okay.MR. JORDAN. I am missing something here because the priorsentence refers to June through September.-75-6/30-7/1/92MR. KOHN. Right.MR. JORDAN. And the latter sentence says that theirrelationship to the long-run objectives is uncertain. Uncertain withrespect to what? Is that compared to before or compared to somethingthat we're less uncertain about?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think there has to be a sentence inthere but I feel uncomfortable with this sentence as it's constructed.MR. SYRON. You're absolutely right; it's a problem.MR. ANGELL. Well, why don't we take "long-run" out? Say"suggests that the relationship between their growth and theCommittee's objectives is uncertain at this time."MR. MELZER. Do we have more confidence in the funds rate?MR. KOHN. It's certainly the case that this problem will beaddressed extensively in the policy record as well as the [directive];it's in the paragraph on the long-run ranges. The draft sentence wasa response to a request made at the last meeting.MR. MULLINS. Is it like the Surgeon General's warning?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I think the recent behavior of theseaggregates--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Perhaps to make it more operationalwe could say "However, the recent unusual behavior of the aggregateswarrants especially close monitoring by the Committee" or somethinglike that.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I agree we do want to solve thequestion. It's obviously making this relationship more uncertain thanusual, whatever it is. We basically have a problem [in that we need]to stipulate the reasons why we are putting in these rather lownumbers. Because if we believe them and those were really functionalwith respect to the economy, then I think it's incumbent on us, asJerry has been saying, to move them up. What we're trying to say hereis a qualification: That while we're putting down these very lownumbers, our view of the importance of these numbers is far less thanis usually the case. That's where the issue is.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Right.MR. KOHN. The sentence feeds back into the previous sentenceor the two sentences before. It says that in the context of theCommittee's long-run objectives you will be looking at monetarydevelopments. So, we've already sort of said that and this kind of--MR. MULLINS. We could say something like "in view of theunusual behavior, we expect growth to be 2 percent and 1/2 percent."MR. SYRON. Using 2 percent and 1/2 percent, I would thinkwe'd want to focus further on the short run by saying that theCommittee is particularly aware of the unusual relationship thatexists with the monetary aggregates. I'd just add something like that-76-6/30-7/1/92tagged on the end, which is not specific to our objectives. This[proposed language] raises as many questions as the problem [we'retrying to address]. Why don't we just say that the Committee wasacutely aware that the behavior [of the aggregates] has been unusual--not necessarily in those exact words.MR. JORDAN. The previous sentence says "The contemplatedreserve conditions are expected to be consistent with...." Is thatwhere the uncertainly is? The last sentence suggests, though it's notclear to me, [not] what is consistent with reserves but what it meansfor the long run.MR. ANGELL. I think you've hit it, Jerry. I think that'swhere the uncertainty is. We're not certain whether the contemplatedreserve conditions are consistent with--MR. SYRON. That's exactly right.MR. BOEHNE. Then, why don't we just say: "The contemplatedreserve conditions, although more uncertain than usual, are expectedto be consistent" etc.MR. KOHN. I don't think it's the conditions that areuncertain.MR. SYRON. The point is that we don't know whether they areexpected to be consistent; we have less expectation of consistency.MR. LINDSEY. Do we have to have the "contemplated" sentencein there? Does the law require us to have a sentence that says "thecontemplated reserve conditions"?MR. KOHN. No, no.MR. LINDSEY. Why don't we drop the whole issue since we'readdressing it elsewhere?MR. MULLINS. We put in forecasts and people notice[unintelligible].MR. KOHN. Well, part of the idea behind putting thissentence in was to give a sense of flexibility--that you wouldn't haveto react to this. Without such a sentence here the directive doesn'trelate at all to the long-run ranges, which may be fine.MR. MELZER. Just by stating those low growth rates on thevery face of it we've indicated that we're willing to accept thosegrowth rates even though they are below the target range. That is theconfusion we're trying to clear up with that last sentence. I thinkwe could take the last sentence out altogether.MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that we could say "Thecontemplated reserve conditions are not likely to cause the monetaryaggregates to return to their targeted ranges."CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We could say "may not."-77-6/30-7/1/92MR. ANGELL. Yes, "may not be consistent with the aggregatesreturning to their ranges."MR. SYRON. "During this period" or "in this period ofuncertainty" or something like that.MR. LAWARE. Isn't it somewhat contradictory, though, to saythat we're tilting toward ease and that it's going to result in alower growth rate for M2 and M3?MR. ANGELL. Well, in a way not, because if we were--MR. LAWARE. That's the way it reads!MR. BLACK. I think we could take that last sentence andattach it to the one before and say "in light of the recent unusualbehavior of these aggregates."MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairman, I hesitate to inject this butperhaps the thought that people have is that the Committee is adoptinga policy that would be expected to move the aggregates back toward therange unless the recent unusual behavior of velocity persists. Thatwould be a correct statement, but a non-quantitative one.MR. ANGELL. I think that's accurate. I don't think weexpect that. Look at this chart in the Bluebook and where "B" is.MR. PRELL. But that assumes that the recent unusual behaviorpersists. What I'm saying is that unless it persists you'd expect[growth of M2] to move back because we would not expect to end up theyear with only 2-1/2 percent [M2 growth] given our GDP forecast ifnormal velocity behavior were to resume.MR. ANGELL. But Mike, Don's chart shows "A" and "B" belownot only the cone but below the parallel lines. Both "A" and "B" arebelow the parallel lines and we ought to communicate--MR. PRELL. I'm saying that isn't necessarily what is knownto be the operative element in your policy concern. It is contingenton a continuation of unusually strong velocity. If you didn't get it,then you would expect [the aggregates] to come back. I apologize forthe diversion.MR. HOENIG. The ranges we have now reflect an expectationthat these [aggregates] are going to fall below [for the year], and Ithink we should drop that last sentence because it only adds--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's try Jerry's suggestion for thelast try at this because we're not--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. This is an alternative sentence thatwould say: "These growth rates in the monetary aggregates are areflection of the continuing, uncertain relationships between theaggregates and the Committee's long-term objectives."MR. JORDAN. But I thought it was the uncertainty about theBoard staff's model and what interest rate and reserve conditions-78-6/30-7/1/92would produce certain aggregates. There are two separate things:There's a velocity issue and--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don't we drop this whole thing?MR. SYRON. Where are you going to start to drop?MR. MELZER. Starting with "however"?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Starting with "however."MR. MULLINS. And ending with "time."MR. SYRON. I think that's a better suggestion. The problemis: Do we really think that these reserve conditions are expected tobe consistent in the world that we're in now?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me put it this way. I would almost[be tempted] to drop the "contemplated reserve conditions" sentence.MR. SYRON. Yes, that's what I would prefer.MR. ANGELL. Well, Mr. Chairman, if we're going to delegateto you some [asymmetry], why can't we delegate to you [the task of]carefully going over this until you're satisfied that you have a[good] sentence? I would prefer to give you the authority to cleanthat up or take it out, whichever one you want.MR. SYRON. Good idea.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That would be helpful if you would. IfI have any serious questions, I will re-circulate a draft to theCommittee if that's okay with everybody.MR. ANGELL. Yes, it would be better than our trying tomanufacture [one as we sit here].CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, this is a tough one. Okay, whydon't we leave that and go to a vote.MR. BERNARD.Chairman Greenspan YesVice Chairman Corrigan YesGovernor Angell YesPresident Hoenig YesPresident Jordan YesGovernor Kelley YesGovernor LaWare NoGovernor Lindsey YesPresident Melzer NoGovernor Mullins YesGovernor Phillips YesPresident Syron YesCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, our next meeting is on August the18th, and we can adjourn for lunch.END OF MEETING-79-
