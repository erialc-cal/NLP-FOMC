Mr. Kalchbrenner, Adviser, Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors  Transcript of Federal Open Market Committee Meeting of March 29, 1976  [Executive session] 
 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we™re ready. This will now be a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and we™re in executive session.  I™m going to call on Tom O™Connell to advise us on the status of the lawsuit. MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  The Committee will recall that the lawsuit of Merrill versus the FOMC, pending in the District Court, had been subject to the court order announced from the bench, and [as of] the last [FOMC] meeting [the lawsuit] had not been the subject of a final written order entered in the District Court.  Since the date of the oral opinion, that court order has been entered, and it quite accurately sustained the oral statement from the 
bench. With respect to the record--minutes of record--which is the subject of the first portion of 
the court™s order, the Record of Policy Actions would be provided immediately [to the plaintiff] 
upon its completion by the Committee.  As the Committee will recall, [that order] was made 
subject to a stay by the court so that the Committee could file an appeal.   That appeal was noted and filed on March 16. So, until further order of the appellate court 
or as otherwise ordered by the District Court, the requirement with respect to the Record of 
Policy Actions will not be in place, and, effectively, the 45-day lag is still the operating date for 
the Committee.   
The second phase of the court™s order, you™ll recall, dealt with the Memorandum of 
Discussion. The second phase required that the Committee, through its staff, remove from the 
January and February 1975 memoranda reasonably segregable facts and that they be given in proper form to the plaintiff as promptly as that could be done.  And should there remain from the 
two memoranda any portion of facts that the Committee claims could not be reasonably segregated, then that portion of the memoranda would be submitted in camera to the District 

Court for inspection by the court and a further judgment and order as necessary.  That was 
required to be done by March 19.  We got an extension of time by stipulation of counsel until the March 24, last Wednesday, and on that date, on behalf of the Committee, there were filed with 
the District Court the documents that you have in the package in front of you.   I haven™t presumed for a moment that anyone has had a chance to look at these documents or that, having had the opportunity, you can fully appreciate what™s in them. 
 In front of you is a report to the court, prepared on behalf of the Committee, in which we advised the court of what we have done, accompanied by an affidavit executed by Mr. Broida in which he recites under oath the steps that had been taken.  Attached to that affidavit are the January and February memoranda separated into two parts.   
[The first part] exemplifies that which was given to the plaintiff and resembles, I must say, 
a blank pad of paper for the two months. The second part, the full Memorandum of Discussion, 
[contains] bracketed [material] to exhibit to the court that which was given to the plaintiff and, 3/29/76 - 2 -  [in] nonbracketed fashion, that which remains--as 
to which we asked the court™s judgment in concurrence in what the Committee has done.   
Now, in the affidavit, I direct your attention for future study and reference to the recitation by the Committee, to its counsel, of the areas of factual representation that were not made known 
to the plaintiff.  That™s found on page 2 of the affidavit.  The statement is made that, while 
certain portions of the materials withheld from the plaintiff can arguably be considered factual in nature, they have not been given to the plaintiff because they fall into one of the following 
categories. Then, three categories are stated, the third of which we are referring to first; these are the materials that were covered by paragraphs 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the court™s March 9 order.  Those are merely the record with policy action types of materials as to which we have an appeal.  Our 
position is that, having had that order stayed--so we are not required to disclose them within the 
45-day lag--we did not intend to make such disclosure from the Memorandum of Discussion.  
For that reason, where similar types of materials were found in the memorandum, we withheld them.   
In the first category are statements principally 
descriptive of procedure, which if disclosed would [reveal] the deliberative, consultative process of the Committee and its staff for exemplification purposes.  [On page 6 of] the January Memorandum of Discussion, which was given to the court as a full memorandum, the first two full paragraphs exemplify that which we™re speaking of.  It reads, ﬁChairman Burns observed that the Committee had planned to discuss the first stage of the report of the Subcommittee on the Directive this afternoon.ﬂ  And then it proceeds through two paragraphs to recite procedures that either the Chairman has suggested would be taken or had planned to be taken, but it contains references to substantive thought and process which, in effect, lead to the deliberative process of the Committee. We elected to remove that from disclosure to the plaintiff [because] it would lead them to knowledge 
of the deliberative, consultative process of the Committee.   
The February Memorandum of Discussion, page
 18, will give you a suggestion of the type 
[of material] covered in the second category in the affidavit.  Turning to the so-called B type of [material]--that is, information received in
 confidence from foreign central banks and 
information relating to negotiations with or 
among such banks, disclosure of which could 
irrevocably and totally damage relations with thes
e banks and result in the cessation of the flow of essential information from them.   
[There are] numerous instances [of this 
type of material] in
 the Memorandum of 
Discussion--references are made to reports from
 members of the Committee, comments from our 
Chairman with respect to conversations that are be
ing held with representatives of foreign central banks. I won™t take the Committee™s time to indi
cate specific examples, 
there are several--a 
common market agreement with respect to servi
ng of the intervention agreements, the rate for 
which they would be made, and so forth.  This type of reference, although containing some 
factual material that arguably could be disclo
sed, would inferentially lead to the type of 
disclosure of discussion of highly confidential foreign central bank exchange [unintelligible] that we felt should not be disclosed.  And for that reason, we have identified to the court, quite frankly, [what] we have withheld and the reasons for it.   
3/29/76 - 3 -  
The affidavit then closes with a request that, if the [judgment of the] court differs from that 
of the Committee and [the court] intends for a
ny reason to issue a contrary adverse order for further disclosure, then we be so advised and be given the opportunity to note this on appeal--and thus we would seek an emergency stay of 
this order in the Court of Appeals.   Mr. Chairman, implicit in our affidavit is an opp
ortunity to appear before the District Court 
and perhaps take suitable steps to comply with wh
atever further order the District Court has in mind.  We have heard nothing from the court on it
s reading, if any, of this document.  We have 
had a phone call from counsel for the plaintiff, w
ho asked for somewhat of a verbal description 
and explanation of the three withholding categories that I have briefly discussed here.  Counsel talked with plaintiff™s counsel and gave exampl
es of both A and B.  He seemed satisfied, he 
didn™t raise any further question, and we haven™t heard any further comment.  Mr. Chairman, I 
think that constitutes a report on this
 filing as the Committee now has it. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. O™Connell.  Are there any questions? MR. COLDWELL.  One question, Tom.  Do yo
u gather any sense or feeling from the 
judge as to the degree of push th
at is likely to be made toward
s release or attempted force of 
release of the Memorandum 
of Discussion item beyond the segregable facts? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, Governor, we
™ve had no conversation with the court or the court™s clerk, so I™m unable to give you any reaction or impression from him.  Our 
conversation with the plaintiff™s counsel did not give us any feeling of total dissatisfaction or surprise on the part of the plaintiff™s counsel that the portion given him was as sketchy as it was.  
One or two comments he made, as a matter [of] fact
, suggested that he anticipated that it would be just about like this.  As I say, the only que
stions he had were to exemplify the types of 
categories we had withheld.  We did so, a
nd subject to Art™s further knowledge, I got no 
impression that he was umbraged or that 
he would push hard for further disclosure. MR. BROIDA.  I might add, Mr. Chairman, that 
the original request we received from this 
Mr. Merrill was for the full Memorandum of Discu
ssion.  And in the course of the pleadings, the request was narrowed to factual portions.  I don™t know why [it was] narrowed, but that was all 
that the judge was faced with in making this
 order.  He requested factual portions. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS. [Unintelligible] to conform to the Freedom of Information Act. 

MR. BROIDA.  Perhaps. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  That might well be the ex
planation of--may I hold the Committee™s 
attention for one more moment, Mr. Chairman, to
 indicate what our possible time schedule may 
be.  I noted that we had filed a notice of appeal.  The D.C. Circuit Court 
calls for the filing of a 
record in the Court of Appeals 40 days after the notice of appeal.  The notice having been filed 
on March 16, [the requirement] means that, by Ap
ril 26, we as counsel for the Committee must 
designate to the Court of Appeals the portions of the District Court 
record that we wish the Court of Appeals to review on our appeal.   Forty days after that date, or, by my calcula
tion, June 6, the Committee must file its brief 
[to the Court of Appeals] in support of its appellate points.  From its submission on--as I™ve 
3/29/76 - 4 -  
calculated--June 6, the plaintiff himself has 30 days, or
 until July 6 or July 7, to file an answering brief.  Within [14 days after] that period of tim
e, this Committee can file a rejoinder brief, so 
that, in total, all briefs being filed, the case [could be] ready for argument as early as July 21, or 
[it] could be later, subject to any extension of time or orders of the court.  That™s all I have, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Any questions or comments? MR. HOLLAND.  Might I ask the Secretary a 
question, Mr. Chairman?  In some of the 
segregable facts, such as one to the plainti
ff, there are included factual statements. [For 
example,] the German Central Ba
nk was intervening in modest am
ounts--it™s certainly a factual statement.  Did the Committee staff ascertain 
whether that was a fact still being held as 
confidential by the fo
reign central banks? MR. BROIDA.  We ascertained it not by cons
ulting with the foreign central bank but by consulting with the staff [at] the New York [Fed
eral Reserve] Bank.  They gave us a judgment 
on each of these points. 
MR. HOLLAND.  As to whether or not it wa
s already a matter 
of, I™ll say, general knowledge, of public-- MR. BROIDA.  The information was in the public domain. 

MR. HOLLAND.  That™s all I wanted to know.  And in each case it was. MR. BROIDA.  They sat down with the memo
randum and read it all the way through and 
identified those passages that pertained [to] information not in the public domain. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Thank you.  And none
 of that [unintelligible] so all that is stuff that the 
New York Bank staff regards as already in the public domain with respect to foreign central bank 
intervention. 
MR. BROIDA.  No, that™s not--let me put it th
is way.  There were a number of cases in which they felt that the public interest would not 
be served by making this information available, 
but we could not find any basis within the criteria that we had agreed upon for withholding it.  And we talked it over and they agreed reluctantly, or less so, to our decision. MR. O™CONNELL.  I should say, too, that in th
ose conversations, where severe reluctance was expressed on the part of the New York Bank staff, we did our best, and I think successfully in two instances that I can recall, to withhold under a valid claim.  In
 all cases, Governor, I believe we satisfied to the fullest extent possible the concerns of the New York Bank staff about each of these items. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, did you leave [in the 
memorandum] any [information] that the 
New York staff did not think was in the public domain? 
MR. BROIDA.  This question gets rather
 subtle, Governor Holland.  There was information here on our own operations which 
is in the public domai
n.  The question was 3/29/76 - 5 -  
whether, by giving this information to the plaint
iff, we had set a precedent such that, in the 
future, we might have to make 
equivalent information available before it came into the public 
domain. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Yes. 

MR. BROIDA.  It was primarily on this i
ssue that they expre
ssed some concern. 
MR. HOLMES.  There™s more to that ques
tion, Governor, of future releases of 
information, which do not lag as much as thes
e do, because we™ve had several--three monthly, 
six monthly--reports.  But as far as these facts are concerned, in the case-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  The plaintiff has made
 no comment publicly on the amount of material or any material of these proceedings? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I know of none, I haven™t heard any, Governor. 

MR. COLDWELL.  [Unintelligible] 

MR. O™CONNELL.  He may have, but it ha
sn™t been brought to my attention. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions? 
MR. BALLES.  Tom, maybe I™ve missed someth
ing, but have you had any feedback of the plaintiff™s complaining or
 commenting on the material that was excised? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  No, I haven™t 
President Balles, and certainly he did not appear to be either surprised or irritated in the conversation we had with him when he was directing the 
questions to us.  I™ve heard of no complaint yet. MR. BALLES.  Thank you. 
SPEAKER(?).  Mr. Chairman, do I understand 
that we are appealing the 45-day lag? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s correct. 

MR. BROIDA.  That™s correct. 

SPEAKER(?).  And that is the only thing that™s being appealed as of now? 

MR. O™CONNELL.  [Yes--] at th
is point in time and subject to some word from the 
District Court as to the court™s satisfaction [or] not with what we™ve done with the Memorandum 
of Discussion.  If an adverse order follows which is more stringent than is now entered, we have 
every intention to advise the Committ
ee in pursuing an appropriate appeal. SPEAKER(?).  Thank you. 

MR. COLDWELL.  Are we left in a position where we could appeal the entire thing on 
even segregable facts? 
3/29/76 - 6 -  
MR. O™CONNELL.  My earlier statement, Gover
nor, at the last mee
ting, was that we felt we were in [a] poor position to directly appeal a court order on the issue of segregable facts because that™s a direct part of
 the law.  On a court mandate for specific portions of the 
memorandum, [which would differ fr
om] our judgment as to what 
is a fact and what is not, I believed we can appeal, and we intend to do so. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very well.  I want to make a comment on the Memorandum of 
Discussion.  Let me recall what 
took place at the latest meeting 
of the Committee.  Governor Coldwell presented a report on behalf of his committee deali
ng with the future of the 
Memorandum of Discussion.  We had a lengthy 
go-around, and the sentiment of the Committee 
clearly was that, with certain kinds of modifications, [the] re
commendations of their committee 
be adopted.  At the end of the meeting, I suggested
 that, while I was in whole sympathy with that 
decision, each of us [might] do a little more th
inking about the future of the Memorandum of 
Discussion and we [would] take a formal vote 
at the next meeting of the Committee.   
The reason I suggested that was that it™s an important matter, a
nd in view of the status of the work in our Secretary™s office, nothing would be changed there, and the delay would have no consequences as far as the Secretary is concerned.
  And each of us could spend a little more time 
weighing that tentative decision.   Well, I have weighed that tentative decision because I™ve [had some] additional 
experience.  In carrying through the exercise ordered by the court, and including now the expurgated [edition] of our memoranda for January
 and February, members of our senior staff 
spent a great deal of time on it, 
a very heavy investment of e
ffort, and I spent 2-1/2 hours, approximately, going over their decisions. [I] di
sagreed with a number of them, didn™t impose 
anything on the staff, but after a full discussion, we arrived at a consensus.   We all recognize that the determination of what is a fact or what is not a fact is a subject 
that is surrounded by great difficulty.  But no two individuals going through that exercise with a lengthy document before them will arrive at the sa
me decisions.  Now I differed with our staff on 
one point--they included factual statements about 
procedures as facts--and convinced them.  I 
argued that what the court was interested in wa
s facts concerning the economy rather than facts 
concerning our procedures, and that argument prevailed with our staff.   
But, looking at the expurgated document, I b
ecame aware of certain difficulties that I had 
not thought of previously.  First of all, here™s a document, and 
the amount of factual material 
[unintelligible] and I can see that [the] document is
 not going to stay with the plaintiff--it™ll be on 
Capitol Hill before very long, and I can [imagine] 
derogatory statements that might be made on 
Capitol Hill.  ﬁThis is what that Committee [does]
.  They sit around, and they talk, and what they know and the number of facts that they consider 
is very scanty. It™s a talking Committee.ﬂ And 
that would cause some mischief.   
Next, I became aware of a fact that individual 
statements, you see, can so easily lead this or 
that member of the Congress to ask for doc
umentation, which obviously must exist, and 
additional reports.  Now, I recognize that the recommendation 
of the Coldwell committee would 
reduce that burden and reduce that difficulty, 
and that was the purpose of that committee™s 
recommendation.  I don™t think th
ese difficulties are going to be eliminated.  I see myself, 
3/29/76 - 7 -  
unfortunately, having to devote a good deal of time after the Committee staff has done its 
work--they™ll come to me with questions because ther
e™s always a gray zone and it™s pretty large.   
I see also the very real possibility that afte
r all of that is done, there will be individual 
statements that will be picked up by members of 
the Congress, or members of the press, or both, 
that will cause us additional work and, what is worse, embarrassmen
t.  And therefore, I want to ponder this matter further.   
But two weeks from today, which is when I 
think the next regular FOMC meeting is 
scheduled-- MR. BROIDA.  Three weeks. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Three weeks from 
today, the chances are that I will be 
recommending to the Committee that we do away 
with the Memorandum of Discussion and that 
we expand the Record of Policy Actions, so that the public will be informed rather promptly, not only of our decisions, but of the reasons for our decisions and of any shadings of views within the Committee.  Now, it means a break with tradi
tion, but so does the sanitized version that the Coldwell committee had recommended.   
We live in a new world, and I think we had bette
r adjust to it.  I have not reached a firm 
decision on that--it™s a painful decision for me, but 
that is the way in which my thinking is going.  
I mention it now to you because we™
ll have to reach a decision. I sa
y ﬁhave toﬂ--we don™t, but we 
should reach a formal decision at th
e next meeting one way or another.
  That™s all I have to say. 
MR. MAYO.  Will there be any more informati
on about the status of the Government in 
the Sunshine [bill] by that time? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we may have a l
ittle more information.  That isn™t going 
well in the legislation.  Our efforts to defeat it 
are not prospering.  We still have a chance, but it 
doesn™t look very good to me.  Do y
ou have any more detailed knowledge? MR. O™CONNELL.  [Unintelligible
] if I may, Mr. Chairman, I brought to the attention of 
the Board [of Governors] at its last meeting the [unintelligible] 
of the Judiciary Committee, in a 
two-day session last week, to enquire into possible conflicts of the existing Sunshine legislative proposal with the Administrative Procedure Ac
t, the Freedom of Information Act, and the 
Privacy Act provisions.  The Deputy Attorney General has called to the Committee™s attention 
several areas in which he felt the proposed legislation, if enacted in its present form, would 
conflict with existing provisions of law and with these other statutes.  He has offered amendatory 
language in several instances, the exact impact 
of which we don™t know at this moment, but it 
could somewhat improve the position of the agenci
es. But the Chairman, I think, is quite correct 
that substantive provisions of the law as now proposed, generally requiring open meetings, stand 
pretty well in place and they won™t be imp
acted by these other amendatory proposals. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we may have a ch
ange on the House floor.  If we do, I have excellent reasons for thinking that we could get constructive assistance from the Senate 
conference. 
3/29/76 - 8 -  
MR. COLDWELL.  May I inquire, Mr. Chairma
n, about the relevance of the Government 
in the Sunshine question to the Memorandum of Discussion? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that that is a complicated legal question involving the 
FOMC, which Tom is still in the process 
of studying.  Is that correct Tom? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  It is, sir.  Does the Chai
rman wish me to comment at all? I don™t 
intend to-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Depends on Mr. Coldwell, whether he wants to hear the complications.  I don™t.  He well may,
 and therefore he™s entitled to. MR. COLDWELL.  Just a ﬁsplash windshiel
dﬂ opinion, Mr. O™Connell.  What do you think that we would have to yield in our Memo
randum of Discussion if we
 had at this time the 
Government in the Sunshine law? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Governor, my ﬁbackseatﬂ opi
nion is that it would depend on the full applicability to this Committee of the Government 
in the Sunshine law as finally enacted.  If it 
should be judged fully applicable to this Commit
tee, and thus [require] an open meeting, then I 
think the issue now of what form a Memorandu
m of Discussion [unintelligible] [would take 
would be] academic because [unintelligible] you w
ould then have to determine what portions of 
that Committee meeting could be closed.  If cl
osed, and all discussion having been transcribed, what portions could be deleted? And then we™re 
back in the same game 
we™re now playing with 
the Memorandum of Discussion.  It is i
nvolved, Mr. Chairman, that™s my point. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions?  Mr. Broida has an announcement to make. 
MR. BROIDA.  We™ve left a little form 
on top of your packages for you to indicate whether you would like these materials mailed 
to you at your [Reserve] Bank or whether you don™t want them and would like us
 to destroy them.  If you check the appropriate box, sign your 
name and leave them at your place, we™ll pick 
them up.  If you want to carry them with you, 
leave it unsigned. MR. COLDWELL.  If I could, Mr. Chairman, I™d like us to retu
rn to this question of the Memorandum of Discussion for just a moment.  
I think it will be well for members of the 
Committee with [unintelligible] think about 
the problems of deleting the Memorandum of 
Discussion entirely, or maintaining 
it in an abbreviated or edited form. It would seem to me that 
the problems which have to be addressed in maki
ng this decision center on two or three points.  First, how much trouble is it going to be to delete segregable facts?  
Second, how much staff 
time and member debate would have to go into 
a discussion of an enlarged Record of Policy Actions? And third, is the Comm
ittee overreacting to a potential mi
schief which might be down 
the road, and should it move in anticipation of that mischief or 
wait until the mischief shows up? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the one question that I think Mr. Broida would be able to answer is--now you send the Record of Policy Ac
tions around to members of the Committee, do 
you not? MR. BROIDA.  Yes sir. 
3/29/76 - 9 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And do you find many 
criticisms made by members of the 
Committee? 
MR. BROIDA.  Very, very few, Mr. Chairman. 
 I™d say perhaps [from] eight of the 12, or maybe one or occasionally two comments, but mo
st of the time we get no comment from the 
[unintelligible].  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I would draw the inference that if the present [Record of Policy Actions] were double their lengths, there would be more comments but it would not be a 
huge burden on the Secretariat.  Is that a fair inference? MR. BROIDA.  I believe so. 

MR. COLDWELL.  Well, I would challenge that 
only to the extent that if we™re attempting 
to double the size of the Record of Policy Action
s to obtain the flavor of each member™s position, 
it is going to [unintelligible] discussion. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That isn™t what I ha
d in mind.  Governor Wallich argued the case 
for the kind of document that I have in mind.  I 
don™t think that this Record of Policy Actions should identify individuals. MR. COLDWELL.  I don™t mean identify. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t think my name or
 the flavor of each individual™s thinking 
should be represented.  Here is [unintelligible], let™s say we do it by symbols.  Here is A™s 
thinking, here is B™s thinking.  Now let us say a 
member of the Committee felt that the Record of 
Policy Actions as prepared by the staff did not convey the majority™s thinking or did not convey 
a divergent sentiment that he had expressed 
clearly to the Committee. He would suggest a sentence or a paragraph, and I would expect the Secretary to adopt it.  Do you have any opinion, Mr. Wallich? 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, I™m wondering what 
would happen, for instance, with minority 
points of view.  If one member of the Committ
ee were to hold a view totally different from 
others, this presumably would have to be stated. 
 It would also be stated that there was little support for it, something that conv
eys the balance of the meeting. 
MR. BROIDA.  If a member dissented, that, of
 course, would be recorded, and his reason for dissenting would be noted. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, wait.  His reason for dissenting would be noted if he 
elected to [explain his dissent].  [But] isn™t that a privilege of a member?  He [could instead] just 
vote. MR. BROIDA.  All the law requires is that th
e vote, pro and con, be shown.  The tradition has been that there™s an explanation for dissents, [but] that would be at the member™s option, 
obviously. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s right. 3/29/76 - 10 -  
MR. WALLICH.  Well, I was thinking of a desc
ription of the arguments presented at the 
meeting, not the dissent as such.  Suppose one pe
rson believes the economy is contracting and then [is] led to believe it™s expanding.  He may not even di
ssent substantively-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But I think the sentim
ent would be indicated.  If I were the Secretary I would indicate that virtually all members of the 
Committee agreed that the economy 
is continuing to expand; and to cover that individual or two [who disagreed], well, I™ll tell you, the Secretary has great skills in that regard.  And 
he has able assistance, and all of the cumulative 
knowledge of the Secretary™s [office] is now in Mr. Broida™s brain, and he would serve us well in that capacity.  We™d have more
 questions with the longer statement, there™s no doubt about that, 
but I doubt it would be a great burden in view of the experience that we™ve had.  Gentlemen, 
we™ll break now and reconvene at approximately two o™clock. 
[End of executive session] 
[Lunch recess] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we are re
ady to discuss the study that has been conducted by the Subcommittee on the Directive, on which Mr. Holland serves as chairman. I 

am going to call on Mr. Holland to indicate to th
e Committee where, in his judgment, we ought 
to come out at the end.  Now, we may or may 
not want to follow [the recommendation of] Mr. Holland™s [subcommittee], but if we know the th
rust of [his] subcommittee™s recommendation, 
then we can follow the discussion in a more in
formed way.  So, Mr. Holland, tell us where you 
think we ought to come out today.   
MR. HOLLAND.  Mr. Chairman, I have been 
mulling over that question ever since the Committee had that preliminary disc
ussion at its last meeting, and 
[I have been] trying to benefit from the comments that had been made to me by members of the Committee as to their 

questions, their aspirations, their understanding, and their own preferences.  Taking all that into account, along with the actual contents of th
e report of my subcommittee, I believe I™d 
recommend that this Committee end today™s di
scussion [by voting to take] three concrete actions.  
[First,] beginning with the preparation for the next meeting of the FOMC, that we replace 
RPD [reserves available to support private nonbank deposits] with nonborrowed reserves wherever RPD appears in the materials prepared
 for the FOMC--that is, in the specification 
sheet, the Bluebook, the Manager™s report, and the Record of Policy Actions.  I believe RPD is non-operational, and I believe we are at a stage where we can fairly replace it with nonborrowed 
reserves.  And [we could] say, if we need to, 
in a brief public announcement, that the operating 
reserve measure we want the Manager [of the Sy
stem Open Market Acc
ount] to take account of henceforth is nonborrowed reserves, not
 RPD.  That leaves for later-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t know what that means, exactly. The Manager has not paid 
the slightest attention to RPD for many 
months, I suspect.  Is that correct? 
MR. HOLLAND.  I suspect that is correct. 

MR. HOLMES.  No member of the Committee 
has mentioned that, sir, for many months. 
3/29/76 - 11 -  
MR. HOLLAND.  In saying this, I am deliber
ately leaving our subcommittee™s separable second decision to whenever the Committee feels co
mfortable [with it]. [That is] to begin putting 
more weight on the operating reserve measure, in
 this case nonborrowed reserves, letting the [federal] funds rate work as a constraint, as outlined by the subcommittee. I believe that is a 
second and separable decision that this Committee can
 reach when it feels comf
ortable with it.  If 
it feels comfortable with it toda
y, grand, but my impression is that you can benefit from a little 
more thinking and, indeed, experience.   To come as close as one can to get ex
perience with that, my second recommendation 
would be that the Committee tell its staff that, in
 all the materials it prepares for the FOMC, it 
should supply the information that would en
able the FOMC to actually use nonborrowed 
reserves and the related analytical techniques, as
 recommended by our subcommittee.  That is, in 
the Bluebook, in the Greenbook, in the Manager™s reports and the Record of Policy Actions drafts, there would be information provided conc
erning nonborrowed reserves and its relation to the monetary aggregates and in relation to
 the fundamental economic variables.   
I™d extend that even to the Manager™s week
ly and monthly reports, where he would [explain how he would] have operated if nonborrowed reserves had indeed been his primary 
target since the last meeting and what he 
thinks might have happened to money market 
conditions had he followed that.  That is as clos
e to a hands-on experiment as this Committee can 
get.  And for a number of months now, he has b
een including in the reports [from] the Desk a 
paragraph that tries to do this.  It may or
 may not have caught your attention, but this 
[recommendation] would urge him to
 include even a little more amp
lified description of that and 
would urge each member of the Committee to give th
at serious attention so that, as you come to 
each meeting of the Committee, you can decide whether you are prepared to put more emphasis 

on [nonborrowed] reserves as an operating target.   Third, I™d suggest that you encourage the staff to continue exploring some of these newer 
techniques for judging the interaction of monetary ma
gnitudes, interest rates, and economic 
variables and [ask the staff] to report to you occasionally on their findings.  This whole body of research--which academics have rather idealistica
lly labeled optimal control theory--is, as has 
often been said at this table, 
not yet a workable scheme of th
ings, but I believe it can provide 
insights in the months and years ahead that
 would be useful to this Committee.  
Finally, I hope you will tell my subcommittee to ju
st keep working away to finish the rest of its assignment.  We are a good bit through but not
 entirely through, so that™s in effect a four-part recommendation. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We can take care of that last recommendati
on at once--we bless your efforts up this point and want you to continue. MR. HOLLAND.  Good--so the ot
her three recommendations-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We can take care of the third, too--let the staff continue [its investigations].   Now, the first recommendation, what does it rea
lly mean?  We have paid no attention to 
RPD, and you are recommending a ceremonial burial and the announcement that a new regime is 
3/29/76 - 12 -  
being instituted.  Wouldn™t it be wiser to se
parate these two? We 
don™t need a ceremonial burial--we can just drop RPD, which has been so much excess baggage, and then announce nonborrowed reserves after experimentation for se
veral weeks or, preferably, several months. MR. HOLLAND.  I thought about that.  The r
eason I didn™t recommend 
it is that I think the Committee would be badly serv
ed if its only announced operating target was a federal funds rate--that it is a matter of prudence-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That is not our operating target--we use the federal funds rate with a view to reaching certain [targets for the] monetary aggregates. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I stand on what I said--I th
ink it is, in practice, our only operating target, and we need to have a structure that has a reserve measure in it that is workable and that 
the Committee can work towards. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the Committee will have to debate that, but as I understand you, you are not really recommending that we adopt the nonborrowed reserves as [part of our] operating procedure immediately and 
use it at the Desk [but rather that we should] let the Desk carry through some simulations, so
me experiments, and advise us. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I am trying to come as clos
e to that as I can without the Committee 
doing it--so that the Committee can 
have the benefit of as close to an online experiment as possible without committing itself 
until it feels comfortable doing so. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think you have made it pretty clear where we want to go, and we™ll debate that later on. And now we™ll turn to a member of the staff, Mr. Kalchbrenner, 
who will advise us on what the studies by our st
aff indicate concerning the relationship between 
the federal funds rate and various measures 
of bank reserves on the one hand and monetary aggregates on the other, and what that relationship seems to be. 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Thank you, sir. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  To guide me, how
 much time do you think you will need? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  About 10 minutes, sir. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you can have 15. MR. KALCHBRENNER.  [Statement--see Appendix.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much
--how good are any of these predictors? MR. KALCHBRENNER.  They all have quite substantial errors on the order of $1.1 billion to $1.8 billion in M1.  None of them is 
terribly accurate in precisely a monthly context.  
For comparison purposes, we have indicated in 
the appendix, in table 3, the month-by-month 
errors for these various equations both for a one-month period and for a two-month average.  In 
the Stage I report, it is obvious, looking at the information that we
 have before us, that none of these techniques promises very precise pred
ictions of M1 or M2 in a one-month period. 
3/29/76 - 13 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, I™m accustomed to 
thinking of our monetary aggregates in 
terms of growth rates rather than in terms of 
dollars. An error of $3 billion--would that be equal 
to a 12 percent error, approximately? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Yes sir. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And therefore an error 
of $1 billion would be equal to a growth 
rate error of plus or minus 4 percent? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Yes sir. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And therefore--looking at nonborrowed reserves in table 3--in seven months the error is about $1 billion, and ther
efore the error is larger than 4 percent.  In other words, you are shooting at 4 percent [and] you might get 8 percent-- 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Plus or minus 4 percent, 
yes sir.  In the absolute errors, [the error for] nonborrowed reserves
 is close to 6 percent. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let™s say the error was merely $1 billion and you are shooting at 4 
percent, and you may get, what, between 0 and 8 
[percent] in what percentage of the cases? MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Two-thirds of the time. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Two-thirds of the time.
 Well, what good is any of this?  Now you 
take one, two, three, four, and five months of 
12, the error is over $2 bi
llion.  And therefore if 
you are shooting at 6 percent, that would be within the range of 
minus 2 and 14 two-thirds of the 
time.  You might as well throw it all away.  Well,
 that™s life.  I mean, why kid ourselves about 
the [unintelligible] of the predictive value when the predictive value is negligible.  Am I wrong? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  No sir, th
e standard errors of the [unintelligible] measures on 
all these equations are as large [as] on judgmenta
l projections that we have looked at over time.  
They are, as you point out, substantial. MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, I think two other 
points might be added.  One is that it is 
true that predictive [error] values are very large on almost any result you choose in a very short 
run.  We only went as far as two months here, whic
h lowers the predictive errors in most cases.  
If you went a length of three, four, five months
, your predictive errors would smooth out even 
more.  I mean they would get smaller, that™s one point. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What would that mean 
in terms of the Committee™s operation?  If 
you go beyond one month?  We meet once 
every three months, we reach a--  
MR. AXILROD.  No, it would mean, for example,
 to use an extreme case--if next month 
you increase nonborrowed reserves $100 million in
 the expectation that money will grow 5 
percent, and [instead] it grew 10 percent, th
en the following month you increase it $100 million 
because you still think it will grow 5 percent and 
it grew 2 percent, then I think it would average 
out over a long period. If you were persistent in
 this nonborrowed reserve relationship, that™s what it would mean.    
3/29/76 - 14 -  
The second point I wish to make is that thes
e are relationships based on an econometric fit, 
as Mr. Kalchbrenner mentioned, and do not make 
any allowance for any efforts the staff would make judgmentally to allow for the special factors. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What makes you think 
that your judgmental efforts produce an 
improvement? 
MR. AXILROD.  That, I judge, is why Governor Holland was asking to do this experimentally. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m not saying they wouldn™t-- 

MR. AXILROD. I was avoiding that-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I know, but you are impl
ying that an improvement will result. 
MR. AXILROD.  I believe, for example, that all through the year we underestimated the 
decline in CDs, but we [didn™t underestimat
e] them as badly as these equations are 
underestimating them.  So, judgmentally, we woul
d have been closer because we would have had to take account of our experience. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I want to turn to anothe
r question--I suspect the bias in this effort 
and I™m going to call the shots as I see them. 
 On page 62 of, I guess, the second stage-- MR. HOLLAND.  If it™s that many pages, it
™s probably the staff supporting document. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s the staff supporting document, and he
re is how it goes: ﬁGiven current incomplete evidence, it appears the federal funds rate should be rejected tentatively on the grounds that, first, the relationship between the federal funds rate and the monetary 
aggregates is not closer than the relationship between nonborrowed reserves or the nonborrowed source base and the monetary aggregates.ﬂ  We
ll, a purely objective statement would be, if 
there™s nothing to choose between them, why reject a federal funds rate? MR. HOLLAND.  The results are weak-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know I want to put this right on the table--there is a monetarist bias, I think, in these documents.  Now that™s all right 
if, first, there is evidence to support it--and even if there is no evidence to su
pport it, if that is the Committee™s inclination. 
But I would be inclined to argue that, just as the quantity of money has its repercussions on the 
behavior of the economy, so do interest rates,
 and if we choose to ignore or minimize the 
importance of interest rates, let™s do that delibe
rately and not because we have a preference for 
the money supply.  And I see, as I say, a definite 
bias, and I can read many statements in the staff 
report that indicate bias to me.  
Now, your answer might well be th
at that™s the trend of thinking in much of the economics profession,
 which I think is true.  Well, interest rates have also played a significant role in the thinking of the economics profession. 
3/29/76 - 15 -  
MR. PARTEE.  This is in determining M1. 
 The question is, can we do better with the 
federal funds rate or with some kind of reserve 
[aggregate]?  I think the an
swer was that there is not much difference. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I think the critical question is, do you put all of your emphasis 
on the growth of the monetary aggregates or
 do you put emphasis on 
that and also on the behavior of interest rates? MR. PARTEE.  I was speaking to that quote you read and also to these tests, which are predicting the ability to determine M1. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s right. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What™s in this monthly model?  Is 
that the federal funds rate? 
MR. PARTEE.  That has some federal funds rate--  

MR. AXILROD.  It simply relates the commerc
ial paper rate and personal income to the 
demand for money, and the federal funds rate dete
rmines the commercial paper rate.  Those lags 
affected-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I also have a couple of other questions--it surprises me, 
if I read this right--the nonborrowed reserves one--it gets very little better when you take a two-month average compared to some 
of the others.  Why is that? MR. AXILROD.  This was a bad year. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It seems to be a 
particularly worse year for that one than for some of the others.  And I 
assume, subject to correction, that this is operating in effect 
without any federal funds constraint in here at all. At least you get worse if you do review some 
[unintelligible] equations, not worse but you would expect to do worse in this practice as soon as you put any other-- MR. KALCHBRENNER.  At least that would be the amount of 
reserves that were targeted and were not achieved because of the constraints-- 
MR. HOLLAND.  No, Jack, don™t you want to an
swer that question the other way around?  
This 1975 was a year in which the Desk probably 
placed more weight on the federal funds rate 
than it would under the proposed technique, and therefore you did more to allow reserves to 
move around, because of your federal funds constr
aint, than would be implied by the Committee 
[directive], and that if the Manager were targe
ting on one of these measures, probably interest 
rates would bounce more, but these 
relationships would be tighter.  Have I said that correctly? MR. KALCHBRENNER.  It is not altogether true that that w
ould be the case in the sense that if the Manager was using the federal funds rate as the target, the reserves responding were subject to the demand for money in the 
bank.  That™s why the results you get-- 3/29/76 - 16 -  
MR. WALLICH.  I think you have two separabl
e problems--one is that the data over the 
period on the review were constrained because of th
e effort not to let the federal funds rate get 
outside its range; that is Governor Holland™s point.  The other point is that, if you had a [non]borrowed reserves target, interest rates would in effect be more variable and you wouldn™t 
be as constrained in pursuing the nonborrowed reserves target as you are now. MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Yes, but I thought the question was in terms of if there were a 
constraint? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Th
e question is, on these equations, it™s necessary to assume you hit the [non]borrowed re
serves target.  If you were using them as a target, you might 
not hit the target, which would make the error greater. 
MR. AXILROD.  Probably wouldn™t hit the target if you had them as a target.  And given 
the margin of error, I wouldn™t knowŠ
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Tell me, your estima
ting equations covered what period? MR. KALCHBRENNER.  The estimating equati
ons covered the period from 1969 through 
1974. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And is that a long enough period to give you stable results?  
Especially in view of the intercorrelation of successive figures--serial correlation? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  With monthly 
data we thought that was enough. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You did. 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Yes. 

MR. AXILROD.  Also, Mr. Chairman, before th
at period, you begin to get interference from the change to lagged reserve requirements.  There™s a noticeable institutional change in 

1968. MR. EASTBURN.  Could I raise a point [about] that?  Steve,
 we™ve done some fairly 
simple kinds of relationships covering some of
 those earlier periods, and there is apparently a favorable performance in relationship [before] 
lagged reserves are put into effective force. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Would you just be good enough to repeat that? MR. EASTBURN.  Yes, a better relationshi
p between nonborrowed reserves [and money] before the [institution of] lagged reserves than af
ter.  This raises, I think, a significant policy 
question, that if we institute a policy whereby the Desk operates on the basis of nonborrowed reserves, with lagged reserves accounting, we may not get very reliable results.  It raises a question as to whether we should ask the subco
mmittee to proceed with its phase III on the 
lagged reserve question before we start to operate on the basis of nonborrowed reserves. 3/29/76 - 17 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, on the matter 
of lagged reserves, the Board™s staff has been working on that, and I for one have the feeling that we ought to make some change there no 
matter what we do as a Committee.  And your st
udies of that are pretty far along, Steve? MR. AXILROD.  Yes, they are, Mr. Chairman, 
and within a matter of three weeks or so, 
well after the next FOMC [meeting]
, we are going to come before the Board [of Governors] with 
a proposition.  Because of that, we ran some of
 the same tests that President Eastburn is 
mentioning, and because of the proximity of [thi
s] meeting, accelerated them, and they did show 
within the sample period the same results.  
That is, comparing running these results with 
contemporaneous accounting as against a two-week
 lag; with a two-week lag your results got 
worse on the order of 25-30 percent, [unintelligible
] percentage annual rates of growth--errors in 
percentage annual rates of growth.   However--I must mention this and just to furthe
r confuse things in a way and I™m sorry to 
do it--but if you then go outside the sample period but still befo
re lag, and outside the sample 
period but still within the contemporaneous period, 
and outside the sample but still lag, then the 
results fall apart again and it™s not so clear.  That is, outside the sample period, the 
contemporaneous accounting did no better than th
e two-week-lag accounting, and I have not 
been able to explain that result.  Within
 the sample period--what you would expect, the 
contemporaneous accounting did much better. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, your sample 
period is a much longer period than the period outside, isn™t it? MR. AXILROD.  That™s correct.  The period outside the sample period was in each case 
one year, and the sample in one case was run six y
ears, and in the other case seven.  But in each 
case there™s one year outside the sample period.  And that™s been our experience.  These things just break down outside the sample period. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, wait--that seems to mean that you have a 
generalization with very little predictive value. 
MR. AXILROD.  With very little consis
tent predictive value, that™s right. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Partee. 

MR. PARTEE.  If I may ask a question?  Jac
k, turning to table 2, now what we™re talking about--the first proposal of the subcommittee--i
s that you substitute nonborrowed reserves for 
RPD as an operating specification.  Table 2, and I™m taking it to mean absolute error--as an 
example, if one compares nonborrowed re
serves to the third line with RPD-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™re on table 2? 
MR. PARTEE.  Table 2. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What year are you on? 3/29/76 - 18 -  
MR. PARTEE.  Well, I™m looking through the 
whole series, because the comment was 
made that nonborrowed reserves were very bad 
and RPD was very bad in
 1975, but as I look at this year-by-year, comparing nonborrowed reserv
es with RPD, I don™t see that nonborrowed reserves were at any time appreciably better than RPD as a predictor over this five-year run.  Am 
I reading that correctly? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Yes sir, you are.  That is correct. SPEAKER(?).  But the Committee did not decide
 to move away from RPDs because of a 
finding that its predictive relations
hip was inferior.  Our basic reason is that this is a magnitude 
that the Manager cannot control in a s
hort-time, sort of 
[unintelligible]-- MR. PARTEE.  Well, I guess my
 question though is that-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Why try to control some
thing which has little predictive power? MR. PARTEE.  That™s exactly my question.  
That is, wouldn™t we be--my question frankly 
is--wouldn™t we be as embarrassed with nonborrowed reserves mi
ssing it by a very wide margin 
as we have been by RPD missing it by a very wi
de margin?  Is there that much to choose 
between one and the other if one assumes that we
™re not going to hit it--that is, that we™re going to have the same kind of difference since we™re 
mainly interested in the monetary aggregates 
rather than these [unintelligible] as we used to 
call RPD?  Would we be that much better off with 
it than we were with RPD? 
MR. AXILROD.  If I might answer Governor 
Partee.  If you had the same federal funds 
rate constraint, in my opinion, 
you™ll miss nonborrowed reserves in exactly the same way that 
RPD has missed; there will be very little difference.
  That is, they™ll be outside the range with 
exactly the same frequency. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Will you improve your
 predictabilities against M1? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, you™re asking me over a 
two-month period.  On the basis of these 
results I would say no, but certainly, over a longer period, I don™t believe the Committee operates 
this way.  But if the Committee operated over a longer period on a nonborrowed target, I believe it would [perform] better than a federal funds rate.  I believe that I would be able to improve on these results judgmentally, but I cannot tell you ho
w much without making that effort.  But I do 
believe that, judgmentally, I could improve cons
iderably on the results Mr. Kalchbrenner has presented. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s put the judgmental factor aside.  When you say 
operating over a longer period, could you make that more concrete for me?  What do you mean 
precisely by the phrase "operating over a longer period?" MR. AXILROD.  Well, I meant in my ow
n mind something quite mechanical, Mr. 
Chairman. I meant that, if the Committee said it wa
nts to increase M1--just put it in an extreme 
way, 6 percent over a six-month period--I believe that we could set a nonborrowed reserves path 

which has a better chance of attaining that than if we said this federal-- 
3/29/76 - 19 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, but I want to understand that.  The Committee makes that 
decision today--does the Committ
ee then go home for six months? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, that™s why I said it™s not a practical point. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Then I don™t know what you™re talking about.  We are-- MR. AXILROD. It could reconvene and reassess and continue on. MR. PARTEE.  Do you mean that, with no fede
ral funds rate constraint, you could hit it better with nonborrowed reserves? MR. AXILROD.  If you are asking me as a technician, ﬁTell me how to get 6 percent, six 
months from nowﬂ-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Wait a minute, 6 percent in what? 

MR. AXILROD.  M1 growth. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  M1. 

MR. AXILROD.  I believe that I could do it better by telling you what nonborrowed reserves to hit than what federal funds rates to hit.  And the only reason I believe that is because I would not have to predict GNP; GNP would not be as strong an element in that factor.  However, 
I might add, again, since I have great confidence 
in Mr. Gramley™s predictions of GNP, it might 
in practice mean that I could do it ve
ry well with the federal funds rate. MR. PARTEE.  This is just doing it once every six months, Steve, is that right?  You™re 
not talking about coming back month after m
onth and adjusting your federal funds rate? MR. AXILROD.  Well, I think by extension you would. 

MR. COLDWELL.  What about 
the prediction capabilities on M1 itself?  We™re 
attempting to make judgments about M1 and se
em to be missing quite often.  Now, are you 
going to be able to predict with nonborrowed reserves with any greater certainty? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that
™s what he™s suggesting. MR. COLDWELL.  But he keeps coming back 
to federal funds as opposed to the other prediction. MR. AXILROD.  Well, I think that question, Gove
rnor Coldwell, is a question of, if I put 
down a nonborrowed [reserves] number, and it may 
be right or wrong, whether that number is 
obtainable. That is a question you may want to address to Mr. 
Holmes.  I should think, within-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Wait now, what is obtainable?  The nonborrowed reserve figure? 
MR. AXILROD.  Yes, I thought that™s what Governor Coldwell was asking. 3/29/76 - 20 -  
MR. COLDWELL.  I was asking if you could forecast in the coming months a 
nonborrowed reserve figure any better than you™ve b
een able to forecast for the M1 figure, if you had one. MR. AXILROD.  Because I can put down a nonborrowed reserve number, and I™m 
believing nonborrowed reserves is controllable.  Whether it is in fact controllable within the margin that the subcommittee addressed, I think 
is an empirical question.  I myself would say 
that, over a month, you™d need broader ranges th
an the plus or minus $50 million.  But I do 
believe it is controllable within some reasonabl
e range, and over a six-month period there would 
be offsets.  I mean you™d miss this way and miss that way. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I believe the subcommittee re
port says that the market factors are at 
least equal to our input into this nonborrowed figure.  If that™s the case, then over a month™s period, the least we have is wide [unintelligible]. MR. AXILROD.  That™s why I keep talking about the long run, Governor Coldwell. MR. COLDWELL.  I hear you. 

MR. HOLLAND.  If I may Mr. Chairman, I thi
nk there are a couple of perspectives in regard to this discussion.  One is that no short-run or immediat
e operating target that we have 
been able to conceive and test
 has anything other than wide ranges of error.  [We have] an 
inability to hit M1 with any short-run target or
 indeed in its relationship with the fundamental 
economic objectives of employment and prices.  
They all have major variances, major errors 
associated with them.  We™re dealing with a se
t of very imperfect relationships as tested 
statistically.  We each have our own judgment
al impressions of how those go and how those 
change.  Those, too, I think most 
of us would say, have turned out in our own experiences to be pretty loose.   So we™re dealing with an imperfect mechanism w
ith a lot of slippages.  I think that such 
work as the subcommittee has done has suggested th
at if we stick to one of these things month 
after month, the errors gradually start to offset
 each other and you tend to settle down a bit over the longer run.  And that™s something of what 
underlies Steve™s comment 
that over a span of 
months, he thinks he could come reasonably close to it. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I still am not grasping 
the point.  I understand Steve™s comment if, 
let us say, with regard to nonborrowed reserves the Committee makes the decision as to where 

we™re going to be for the next 6 months, and in
 the meantime did nothing else.  We don™t meet, 
or we meet and talk about all kinds of things
 but don™t change that target figure, then I understand Steve.  But if we™re going to make
 adjustments month by month, then I no longer 
understand Steve, and I want to understand. MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, if I might take
 a try at one other way, and again putting it in a slightly extreme phase.  Suppose-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™re going to have monthly adjustments. 
MR. AXILROD.  Yes. 
3/29/76 - 21 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Okay. 
MR. AXILROD.  Suppose the Committee does ha
ve a long-run target of a 6 percent 
increase in M1, and then it meets and says [tha
t in the next] two-month period--a normal two-
month period--it [still] wishes M1 to grow at 6 percent, and the staff provides a nonborrowed reserve number which we believe will attain that.  It turns out that
 M1 grows at 9 percent.  The Committee meets again and says ﬁI still want M1 [t
o grow at 6 percent].ﬂ  If the staff tells the Committee that, based on past experience, it thinks 
that [the previous change in M1 was] within the range of error, then there 
is no reason [for the Committee] to 
change its attitude toward the 
increase in nonborrowed reserves.  You™re not going to get another 9 percent [increase in M1].  Indeed, you might get a 6, you might even get a 3.  
And therefore, the staff says, if you want to stay on the 6 percent path, then increase nonborrowed reserves by the same amount that you 
increased it at your previous meeting.  Then it wi
ll probably turn out that you™ll get 3 percent in M1 the next time.  You begin av
eraging--it will average out. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What™s the evidence for that statement, and for your saying 
ﬁprobably.ﬂ MR. AXILROD.  The evidence for that stat
ement--it™s not here, and we™ll ask Mr. 
Kalchbrenner if I™m right or wr
ong--is that, if you averaged out over a period of more than the 
one or two months we had here, if you averaged out over a period of four or six months, I believe 
the error would be a lot less than the 0.9. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  How much less? 

MR. AXILROD.  Well, that I don™t know. 

MR. KALCHBRENNER.  I don™t know what the current number is, we haven™t had time 
to compute that, but we could certainly do it. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That
™s still true on all these 
models.  Is it going to be 
more true of the nonborrowed reserves model than 
either of the first two you have listed, which look a lot better than the [unintelligible]. MR. AXILROD.  In my mind, President Volcker,
 the only way I would be able to work it down into my own mind is a matter of choice.  
But in the first models, what you have entering strongly is that some
 proxy in relation-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Wait a while
, in the first two models? 
MR. AXILROD.  The monthly and the Shadrack Skinner.  What enters into those two models are either personal income or business 
sales.  So they depend essentially on the GNP projection as per an important interval.  And if
 the GNP projection is wrong, they will be wrong. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  How do you use the GNP projection?  Is it the absolute figure or 
the increment? 
3/29/76 - 22 -  
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Let me check the exact fo
rm of the equations that were used.  I 
can tell you that, sir. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Do you see the reason for my question? 

MR. KALCHBRENNER.  In the Shadrack Skinner equations, it™s the 
change in business sales related to a change in M1. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What about the monthly model? 
MR. KALCHBRENNER.  That is
 also the increment. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The increment, all right. 

MR. AXILROD.  So in the nonborrowed reserves equation, the unpredicted element--I 
mean the element that we can™t control--that ente
rs is interest rates ge
nerally.  I mean, given 
nonborrowed reserves.  To use a technical term, the elasticity i
nvolved, the interest rate--in a nonborrowed reserve [equation], the interest rate variable has less power, so to speak, in influencing the result, than the GNP variable has in the other two equations.  So if you believe you™re going to make big errors in projecting GN
P, you™re better off with your reserve equations, and if you believe you™re not, then you can work
 very well on your money market conditions, 
and I would not quarrel with that result. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  These mode
ls put in the actual GNP figures. MR. AXILROD.  That is correct.  They are 
based on actual GNP.  We have not tested 
them with the GNP as we thought we knew it the
n, which would be a reasonable test to run. SPEAKER(?).  It sure would. 

MR. COLDWELL.  Your element 
of controllability, Steve, that you mentioned before with 
regard to prediction of nonborrowed reserves versus money supply, is [higher than] 
controllability in federal funds.  Right? MR. AXILROD.  Well, I don™t think we have an
y problem in controlling the federal funds 
rate.  We have some problems in market reactio
ns when we move it and none in controllability. MR. COLDWELL.  I agree, but you also--what, you™
ve taken a fast look at is the question of federal funds as this proxy target as opposed to nonborrowed [reserves], and I guess you just tentatively, anyway, said that™s not so good. MR. AXILROD.  In terms of controllability, I don™t think there™s any question that the federal funds rate is controllable.  The question of
 controllability entered 
in [as], of the reserve 
measures, which is the most controllable?  A
nd the most controllable in my mind is the 
nonborrowed base.  And the second most controllable is the nonborrowed reserves. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Wait now.  The nonborrowed base. What is the nonborrowed base--[nonborrowed reserves] plus currency? 3/29/76 - 23 -  
MR. AXILROD.  That™s right.  That means you 
don™t have to predict currency.  But it might be viewed [as producing] somewhat more
 money market distortion, and you have big 
movements in currency re
lative to the politics. 
SPEAKER(?).  As you know, accounting costs. 

MR. HOLLAND.  I think there™s another consid
eration at some stag
e in our discussion, and before we™re under the Government in the Sunshi
ne [law], so, Art, I™m not in the minutes at 
this point here.  [I] thought this could be said [just] across the table.  You™ll recognize there™s a place or two in our subcommittee report where we sa
id that some of the desired results in terms 
of aggregates could probably be gotten using either a reserve operating target or a federal funds operating target.  Theoretically we could get the kind of results to which the Committee aspired 
with either one of those two alternative opera
ting mechanisms.  One of the main reasons we 
opted for nonborrowed reserves instead of federal funds as a short-range target was a reason that can only be called a matter of political science 
and not economics.  Secondly, when it comes to 
describing the ultimate target-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What are the reasons? 

MR. HOLLAND.  Well, I was going to come to 
that in a minute.  And I was going to say 
there is also [an option] in terms of whether or
 not we specify our long-run objectives [in terms 
of] income and employment, and price increases
. The reasons why this report opts not to do those are reasons rooted as much or more in pol
itical science as in economics.  The reason on the 
short-run side, the political science reasons for not naming the fede
ral funds rate as our exclusive operating target are two, fundamentally, I think.   
One is, we felt the System would occasionally be [beset], if it so overtly accepted the 
responsibility for hitting an interest rate--for sett
ing an interest rate, if 
you will, and for setting 
the federal funds rate that is recognized as a key in the whole interest rate framework.  An 
interest rate setting is a kind of lightning rod in terms of some
 of the public discussion about monetary policy, and its problems and its consequences, and we would simply increase the chances for involving this Committee and the Fede
ral Reserve [unintelligible] if we had an 
interest rate operating target.  That™s one of the reasons we thought it was wise to keep a reserve target in place for use by the Committee in order not
 to be so closely associated with a particular 
interest rate target. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, let me just stop 
you there [unintelligible].  How would you characterize our practice over the past few years? 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, I think there™s been kind 
of an evolution over the past few years.  But I would say that, in the last year or two, we have basically been moving the funds rate 
around in the interest of trying to generate monetary aggregat
e results we were satisfied with, subject to a constraint on the amount of interest 
rate change we™d make 
in any short-run period.  What we published doesn™t say that quite that clearly, but I could say in practice that™s what 
we™ve been moving toward.  And I think it would be desirable to keep a reserve target--a short-
run reserve target--in the picture in order to st
ay away from naming a s
hort-run interest rate 
target so overtly as the System™s objective. 
3/29/76 - 24 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You don™t mean that the federal funds range would be done away with? 
MR. HOLLAND.  No, no.  There would 
be a federal funds range under the subcommittee™s proposal, and it™s a 
range that starts out being plus or minus 1 percent but within 
which the funds rate might move.  We suggested
 a quarter percent a week--that™s not much different than the pace of change we™ve had at times in the past.  So we weren™t going to cut it 

out differently, although we did contemplate that experience might le
ad us to widen that federal funds range a little bit.  We also contemplated
 that there might be times when the Committee 
would be concerned with the money market and it 
wouldn™t want that range to be that way, and we felt that the controlled procedure we specify allows for that too.  But we thought in general 
that it would be wiser--safer, 
if you will--for the Committee to
 have something besides an 
interest rate as a short-range 
operating target.  And, indeed, I th
ink the Committee itself has often 
times reflected that same kind of attitude. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Suppose the Committee we
nt along with your thinking on the role 
of nonborrowed reserves, and we set certain targets for nonborrowed reserves.  Now could we also have a federal funds rate constraint with the range of move
ment of the federal fund rate 
being limited, let us say, to 3/
4 of 1 percent, or 1 percent? MR. HOLLAND.  Definitely. 

MR. PARTEE.  Then you™d miss the nonborrowed reserve [target]. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, how would that differ from the present procedure, 
which is what we™ve done in the last few months, pretty much? 
MR. HOLLAND.  It wouldn™t differ very mu
ch, I mean, except we would be missing 
nonborrowed reserves instead of RPD.  The Committee would have, however, I think added 

[unintelligible] hand to you. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What I™m having a little 
difficulty with is, RPD is dead--it™s been 
dead for some time.  Now to say that we™re substituting nonborrowed reserves for something that 
is dead, that troubles me.  Th
at either means  that nonborrowe
d reserves will be stillborn--and 
you can™t possibly mean that--therefore, you mean
 something is going to be introduced which 
will have life and significance in contrast to 
RPD, which now has none.  It™s not that we™re 
substituting one thing for another.  RPD is dead. MR. HOLLAND.  Well, now it™s a little wors
e than that, Mr. Chairman.  RPD is non-
operational, but it is very existent in our records, in our policy statements. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s true
, but that™s just excess baggage that we™re carrying and should have abandoned long ago; we haven™t done so, and maybe there were good reasons.  But 
it is dead, and therefore, you™re not substituting n
onborrowed reserves for something that exists.  
You™re introducing something new. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, I think you™re thinki
ng in terms of operational results, Mr. 
Chairman, and I™m trying to think of two thi
ngs: one, operational significance, and second, sort 3/29/76 - 25 -  
of public significance.  RPD is still playing a publ
ic role.  It provides a complement to the funds 
rate so we don™t appear to be aiming exclusively at the funds rate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  RPD is unfortunate
ly misleading the public, because we™re 
publishing that among our targets, and we pay ab
solutely no attention to it.  Is that an exaggeration, Al? MR. HOLMES.  No, I think that™s true. 

MR. HOLLAND.  That™s true.  Now what the subcommittee is recommending is that the 
Committee work toward the time when it can tell its Manager, pay some attention to 

nonborrowed reserves.  So the subcommittee clearly 
wants that to happen and the only question 
about how soon it tells him to start paying atten
tion to it is a question of the Committee™s own 
learning period. MR. WALLICH.  We had several-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, in terms of th
e goals towards which you™re striving, would 
this make sense, Bob, to drop RPD?  Just 
drop it henceforth, now, and not as yet adopt nonborrowed reserves.  Wait a few months, have some further study or indicate we™re thinking 
of it, but haven™t yet arrived at it.  Would that make sense from your viewpoint? 
MR. HOLLAND.  Operationally--I think we might 
be a little slower to get to the time 
when we actually do it--we said something like that 
to the Manager last summer.  We said to the 
staff, we™ll keep track of nonborrowed reserves and see how it goes--and I believe the Committee™s members really had not done that, that
 we need to do a little more.  Press the Committee a little more to raise its attention to
 nonborrowed reserves so it gets comfortable 
enough with the magnitude and what it does so it 
can make a decision on it.  That™s answer 
number one.   
Number two, in the public arena, I think th
at it would be unfortunate if the Committee 
dropped a reference--any reference--to a short-term reserve target, so that the only short-term 
operating target we were then publishing was a federal funds target.  That makes us an interest 
rate [targeter]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but how can the Committee publish a nonborrowed reserve 
target if the Committee hasn™t yet decided that th
at is a desirable thing to do?  Or how much 
attention to devote to it?
 MR. HOLLAND.  I believe it could publish a no
nborrowed reserves figure and----to the extent that the Committee directs 
the Manager to give weight to an operating reserve measure in 
its day-to-day operations--say to the public that this
 is the operating reserves measure that we are 
going to tell him to pay attention to. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but if the Comm
ittee continues to operate as it has been doing for some time, paying no attention to RP
D and as yet not being thoroughly convinced about nonborrowed reserves as a target--and your recommendation is that 
we™re not quite ready 3/29/76 - 26 -  
for it, we ought to have further study and experi
mentation--then why should we put down such a target? 
MR. HOLLAND.  I think what we need a little more of is the Committee getting used to 
nonborrowed reserves. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, all right, then
 why not wait until we are used to it, sufficiently used to it, and then adopt it as the target? MR. HOLLAND.  Because I think 
that over the last six months
 we™ve demonstrated  that [nonborrowed reserves] has to [be] pushed harder on the [thinking of] Committee members than 
it has to date for them to acquire that kind of
 feeling and comfort with it and that kind of awareness of some of its streng
ths and some of its weakness. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But now I™m thinking of our public posture.  I think we owe it to ourselves and to the public to drop RPD, since we™re paying no attention to it.  But is it really 
proper for us?  Might it not be pr
emature to indicate that we ha
ve a nonborrowed reserve target when we™ve reached no such decision, and are not 
likely to do so today, and when that isn™t even 
your recommendation? 
MR. HOLLAND.  If I have misread the willingn
ess of the Committee to pledge allegiance 
to nonborrowed reserves, I retreat, but I don™t 
think I have, and I believe the Committee will 
move in that direction better if it, in effect, puts it in place. 
 And I believe that if it doesn™t put it 
in place now, it is going to be more awkward for 
us, distinctly more awkw
ard for us, to do so as time goes on. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I can see the Co
mmittee putting out a release saying we™re 
dropping RPD, we have not found it useful, and we are considering substituting for it nonborrowed reserves and some fu
rther studies are under way.  Now that, I think, would be completely in harmony with your suggestion 
and yet not involve a commitment by the 
Committee or an indication to the general public th
at we™re doing something that we as yet have 
not decided to do. MR. COLDWELL.  Why do anything, Mr. Chairm
an?  Why not just commit ourselves to 
looking at this question four months from now, or 
three months from now, and say, ﬁAll right, at 
that time we will substitute it.ﬂ 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But I feel somewhat unc
omfortable, and I think probably all of us 
do, in continuing to publish the RPD figures, which are sheer ritual, ritual that doesn™t even have emotional value. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I agree they 
are not useful.  My question is, does another three months 
of publication hurt you at a time when you could 
make the substitution three months from now? 
MR. EASTBURN.  May I ask Alan to clarify something he said before?  Is RPD positively 
misleading the [unintelligible] market? 
3/29/76 - 27 -  
MR. HOLMES.  I don™t think many people in th
e market are paying much attention to 
RPD. 
MR. EASTBURN.  So, as far as-- 
MR. HOLMES.  Now, maybe in some academic ci
rcles they are, but I would say not very 
much. MR. EASTBURN.  I see. 
MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, could I point out, 
too, that in our [unintelligible] directive the Committee regularly calls attent
ion to reserve availability without specifying RPD, and I see no particular harm, Governor Holland, in dropping 
RPDs but saying that we™re continuing to pay attention to various measures of 
reserve availability without opting for a particular one at this 
point. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, th
at™s another possibility. MR. HOLLAND.  But that™s kind of calling not
hing something, I think, Alan.  I think the 
Committee-- 
MR. HOLMES.  RPD certainly is nothing [unintelligible]. 

MR. HOLLAND.  No, I mean there wouldn™t 
be anything at all in the Committee™s specifications in that sense.  But suggesting a 
reserve aggregate that the Committee was tracking 
and following along--it seems to me that is
 of underlying help, underlying value to the Committee. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, but Bob you have not recommended that this be done as yet.  You recommended further study. 
MR. HOLLAND.  No, no, Mr. Chairman I said 
[unintelligible] and have it up, so as soon as the Committee is ready to pledge allegiance to 
it, its results are there.  And in the meantime, 
the Committee can follow how Alan™s reports say he
 would have used it, and they can see what the staff would serve up. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know, if Alan comes and tells us week by week or 
month by month what he would have done, I think it™s going to be very confusing, really.  I would rather think that we request Alan to take 
some specified number of
 months, it might be as short as three--six probably would be better--and ask him to simu
late Desk operations during that period on the assumption of a nonborrowed reserve ta
rget and how that target might be set for 
him by the staff, you see, and how we would ha
ve fared and what the difference would have been.  And in addition, to simulate over this pe
riod what Desk operations would have been like and what the results with regard to the mone
tary aggregates would have been if nonborrowed reserves had received a certain specified weight along with M1 and M2 in the Desk™s operations.  Could you do that, Alan? 3/29/76 - 28 -  
MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, we™ve done a great deal of that work going back through 
last June up through the end of March.  All of this, of course, suffers from one big defect, and that is, if you™re not operating on a nonborrowed reserve target, as soon as you get away from the 
base [period] you know your numbers become less 
and less meaningful.  I think maybe we can 
report on the first two [unintelligible] after a Committee meeting.  That would be more 
significant.  We™ve done all this other work, and I must say it™s not very good. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You say it™s not very good. 
MR. HOLMES.  No, but it does suffer from a fu
ndamental defect, which is that we™re not 
operating on a nonborrowed reserve target and so therefore we may be [seeing] results that are 
peculiar in terms of nonborrowed reserves. 
MR. BLACK.  You also have more constraint
 on your federal funds than you would have under this scheme. 
MR. HOLMES.  Presumably, although that still 
can™t be decided, this is the presumption 
that the Subcommittee on the Directive made. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I see no distinction, Mr. Chairm
an--or, if you™re drawing a distinction, I miss it--between what I was suggesting that Alan 
do in terms of keeping track of how he would operate and what the results might be, and what
 you™re implying when you say simulate.  I think 
the intellectual operation comes to the same thing. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Ah, well, without belaboring the difference, you would have him 
report at every meeting, and I™d have him report afte
r a period of months.  But in view of what 
Alan said, your suggestion is better than mine.  That™s the wa
y I interpreted Alan™s comments. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Even
 that strikes me as being 
very difficult.  You™re more than a few days away and you™re engaged in some operation, and the 
situation is different. MR. HOLLAND.  The reason is--what we™re stru
ggling with--is trying to find ways to make this Committee feel as sure as it™s likely to 
be able to feel in a highly uncertain world of what™s going to happen before it makes that d
ecision to change the em
phasis that it has now come to place on federal funds and shift it instea
d in the direction of a short-term aggregate 
reserve target. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What troubles me, Bob, is 
that I start out philosophically thinking this is a good idea, but the more you learn when you look at these numbers, the less it 
seems to be borne out statistic
ally, and the more you wonder whet
her it™s just a question of getting the Committee used to it.  This re
ally doesn™t look very good in substance. MR. HOLLAND.  Neither does short-term intere
st--neither does the funds rate as a guide. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Looks better than nonborrowed reserves--that™s all you can say. MR. HOLLAND.  No, I don™t think that would be
 true if you ran through all the evidence. 3/29/76 - 29 -  
MR. JACKSON.  I™d like to ask a question, Mr. Chairman.  Maybe our problem is our 
concept of measures of these monetary aggr
egates.  Perhaps we should move toward John Balles™s suggestion of a longer-term measure in
stead of  a shorter-term measure and then 
measure the operational aspects against that concep
t of M1 rather than the shorter-term concept 
of M1.  Then we could in fact produce the type of relationships where something makes some 
sense.  And we all have to admit that as long 
as you stick with the short-term concept of M1, 
nothing is going to make any sense. 
MR. BALLES.  Exactly. 
MR. JACKSON.  And that only when we go to a longer-term concept will any of this begin to make any sense, and maybe our defini
tion of what we™re looking for ought to change rather than the way we look for it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that™s a fair question. 

MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, I think we ha
ve two ways of looking at the funds rate here.  As I understood our subcommittee™s work, the reason we™re tending to move away from it 
is that the funds rate may be a very good predic
tor of M1, but it is a good instrument [only] if 
you™re willing to move it around vigorously to get 
the M1 or other aggregates that we want.   
We treat the funds rate in two senses: in one sense as an instrument and in the other as an 
objective in itself as a proxy for other interest rates and something therefore that we don™t want 
to move as vigorously as we may have to in or
der to get the [behavior of] aggregates [that we want]. In the past, this has often caused trouble.  And as it causes the aggregates to run away or 
to lag, the funds rate has proved to be a poor lever even though it™s an effective lever if it™s used [aggressively].  That™s where we were going and I thought we
 were going probably to a less accurate 
nonborrowed reserves instrument.  Now if we could pr
evail on ourselves to treat the funds rate as we would treat nonborrowed reserves, namely, purel
y as an instrument and not at all as an 
objective, then I think it would be the superior thing.  But we™re not able to do that for pretty convincing reasons. MR. BALLES.  I™d like to pick up on the point
 that Governor Jackson just made, because 
it also perhaps expresses in a sharper way what Steve Axilrod was trying to tell us a little while ago--these tests of the predictiv
e ability of nonborrowed reserves
 for M1 on a one-month basis or 
a two-month basis obviously leave a lot to be desire
d because the margin of 
error is very large. But what we do know, because this has been pret
ty thoroughly tested, is that there is some 
minimum span of months, probably between thr
ee and four, that you need on money supply data 
so that these random errors on the monthly seasona
lly adjusted value begin to cancel out.  And if we were to look at our aggregates target as being some version of this smooth series, a moving 
average of some number of months, 
three or four, then I think that the kinds of errors that Jack™s 
paper came up with in 1975 would appear far sma
ller and far more [acceptable], and perhaps we 
ought to run through that exercise.  Jack, would that be feasible to do? MR. KALCHBRENNER.  Yes sir, we can do that. 
3/29/76 - 30 -  
MR. BALLES.  I™m fairly confident that we™d 
get numbers that would look far better than 
the ones you came up with in a one- and two-month test. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I don™t think there™s any ques
tion, John, that that™s the way the results would come out.  There is a lot of noise in 
the month-to-month bounces that smooth out a bit 
over some span of time. Whatever operating in
strument you™re talking 
about has a lot more short-run noise than long-run persisting influence.  Henry is harking at something that I meant to 
be subsuming under my comments 
about political science reasons for talking about a reserve target as well as a federal funds rate target.  I believe myself, from sitting and watching this 
Committee in years past, that when the federal 
funds rate was its predominant operating target, 
you could pick critical points when that has le
d the Committee to be too 
slow and too late in 
making its major cyclical adjustments in monetary policy.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Is 
that necessarily true? 
MR. HOLLAND.  No, that™s an expression of ju
dgment.  Because it™s not the kind of thing 
you can empirically test, or run against an equatio
n.  That™s another way of saying the same kind 
of thing Henry™s trying to say.  And it is one of the things that led me and, I believe, other 
members of the subcommittee to urge that a re
serve operating instrument be available to the 
Committee as well as a funds rate--because
 of that pattern back over time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I wonder how mu
ch difference it really makes.  Now suppose you have a reserve target, and to achieve that reserve target you find that interest rates keep on shooting up at a rate which members of
 the Committee will find disturbing because of 
prospective economic effects, and 
I™ll say nothing about your political science.  What™s the use 
of kidding ourselves--not all of us, I know, but some 
of us do regard interest rates as playing a significant role in th
e economic process. 
MR. MORRIS.  I think the virtue of the system, Mr. Chairman, in that context is that the 
Committee would be clearly alerted to the fact th
at if it holds down the funds rate over a period of several months, it is highly probable that it 
will get a pattern of monetary growth which is 
excessive and will exceed its longer-run targeted 
numbers.  I think that, in the sense that the 
Committee has this brought forcibly to its mind 
at every meeting, I think we™ll face up more 
realistically to this choice
 we™ve got ahead of us.  MR. WALLICH.  I don™t see focusing on the ag
gregates as in any way denying that money works through interest rates.  I think that is
 precisely how it does work.  But our question is, should we achieve interest rates directly by setting the federal funds rate and making a judgment 
as to what™s the right interest rate, which is hard to do in times of inflation, or should we go with 
the aggregates and trust that they will produce 
the right interest rate because, under inflation 
conditions, that™s a safer guide?  
We don™t know what interest rates 
we want, but we think that a reasonable rate of money growth will produce an 
appropriate interest rate.  That™s how I view 
our procedures. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s one way of looking at it, and another way of looking at the world is to judge what reasonable moveme
nts of interest rates are from the viewpoint of 
our more basic economic objectives. 
3/29/76 - 31 -  
MR. WALLICH.  Well, in the funds rate th
ere are notches where one becomes concerned, 
say, when it [unintelligible] approaches disintermediation level, but other than that, it™s really very difficult to say now what is a rate that contributes to stable growth. MR. MORRIS.  And I think to follow up on the point that Mr. Axilrod made, I think that to 
the extent that we choose a rate without careful consideration as to the probable monetary growth 
that is to be associated with it
, we™re very likely to run off course in those instances when our economic forecast is wrong.  To the extent that 
we™re focused on reserves as our operating target, 
I think we™re less vulnerable to making mistakes 
when the forecast is wrong than we are when 
we are pursuing the federal funds rate target. MR. HOLLAND.  No. 

MR. WALLICH.  I also tend to think that 
changes in rates are significant, and they probably are.  The immediate effect
 of going from one Treasury bill rate to another, particularly from one long-term rate to another, is pretty
 major.  And for that reason we may delay the 
necessary adjustment that would co
me about automatically if we stuc
k to some rate of growth of 
the aggregates. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, this assumes that
 we know, or have a way of knowing, what rate of growth of the aggregates will 
produce optimum results for the real economy-- 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, I think we-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --and your argument seems 
to imply that we know that as far as 
monetary aggregates are concerned, 
but do not know that as far as interest rates are concerned.  I 
can grant the second part of the argument without 
also granting the first. MR. WALLICH.  Well, my argument is that it™
s a little easier via the 
aggregates and only at a time of inflation, when you really don™t know 
what the real interest rate is,  With the 
aggregates, you know at least that you™re not way out of the ballpark--7 percent cannot produce enormous inflation or it 
cannot produce stability. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You know, each one of us has his own impression both of what 
economic proof is, or may be, and also of Federa
l Reserve policy.  I think that, as a practical matter, we have been aware of two channels of
 influence on the real economy through monetary 
policy.  First, through the monetary aggregates, 
and second, through interest rates, and we paid attention to both.  I think that the Committee--ove
r the years, we™ve made our mistakes, but we 
haven™t done too badly.  Sometimes the emphasis is 
shifted in one direction and sometimes in the 
other direction.  I think that by paying attention to both we are probably utilizing what economic 
knowledge exists more wisely than if we put a
ll our bets on one rather than the other.   Now in fairness to your subcommittee, the 
subcommittee that you served on with Mr. 
Holland, you™re not ignoring interest rates, you have an interest rate constraint.  But you would allow the federal funds rate to move within a wi
der range than we typically have--for example, 
during the past year.  And second, in response to a question of mine, Mr. Holland has indicated 
that the narrow range we have had during the past year and many months for the federal funds 
3/29/76 - 32 -  
rate is entirely consistent with the recommendations
 of this subcommittee. 
 I think you said that Bob. MR. HOLLAND.  Would the mechanis
m put in place by the Committee-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh yes, not with the--the mechanism. 
MR. HOLLAND.  The FOMC could occasionally vote to narrow its range, it could vote its federal funds rate ranges and it could widen them. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I realize that your subcommittee would favor a wider range, 
but as far as the mechanism is concerned and 
the accent that you think is proper for nonborrowed 
reserves, all that could be respec
ted and we still could operate either occasionally or invariably, if we so chose, with a narrow federal funds rate range. MR. HOLLAND.  Yes, we™d be having a num
ber of meetings to deal with the 
inconsistencies in the specifications, undoubt
edly, but the Committee could do that.   
I™m conditioned very much on this recommendation by two underlying things.  One, time 
and again, this Committee is going to have to 
reach mental compromises on how it feels about 
what™s happening in the aggregates and how it feels about what™s happening to interest rates and attach a relative weight in terms of those two effects on the re
al economy.  We™ve done it in the 
past and we™re going to have to do it in the future.  It seems to me to be as clear as can be that 
that™s going to happen, and we need to be usi
ng a mechanism that the Committee can work with 
as sometimes [the Committee] accentuates one 
and sometimes the other.  I believe this 
mechanism we™re suggesting to th
e Committee lends itself better to 
that than the mechanism we 
have now.   Second, when the Committee is making mistakes, I believe the mechanism our 
subcommittee is suggesting will wo
rk a little better than the m
echanism we have now or the 
mechanism we™ve had in the past.  If the Commi
ttee always has everythi
ng figured out, then it doesn™t make any difference which variable you 
start with because you™ll have the linkages figured out, and you™ll get the right results.  The real critical-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Not that, we™ll get 
the right results because we™re lucky. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, luck has saved us more than once, and I hope she does again.  
One of the critical points of distinction [bet
ween mechanisms] comes when the Committee is 
wrong and the real economy is doing something 
and the financial system is doing something 
different from what this Committ
ee has foreseen, what it wants, 
and what its staff projections suggest ought to happen.  When you have that
 kind of error developing, I believe the kind of technique the subcommittee is putting forward to 
the Committee will surface that error for the 
Committee™s attention a little soone
r and a little more closely than the mechanism we™re using 
now. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You know, from the viewpoi
nt of public relations, one could make 
an argument in favor of your recommendation 
along the following lines:  We have no way, 
really, of controlling M1 or M2--the linkage between reserves and these monetary aggregates is 
3/29/76 - 33 -  
loose, and the multiplier, if you want to call it 
that, keeps on shifting and it™s unpredictable.  
What we can control is reserves, and more sp
ecifically, nonborrowed reserves.  We set certain 
targets for ourselves that we believe are reasonable on the average, and that is something that we 
can do and we are doing.  And we™re obtaining the targets that we have set, and don™t ask us to do that which we can™t do.   Now there may be a certain advantage in that
 in our public relations, but that goes very much further than anything you™ve recommended, 
you see, because you still want M1 or M2 or 
M3, and it becomes only a question of how you can be
st get there.  What I™ve just said goes far 
afield from that:  nonborrowed reserves, the 
quantity we can control--we do no more, and don™t 
ask us to do any more; 
we™re not magicians. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, nonborrowed reserv
es has a lot of attractions for me if 
we use it as a substitute for attention to M1 in a short time frame.  But if we™re merely adding the 
nonborrowed reserves as another element for incons
istency purposes, I have a lot of trouble with that. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What™s the trouble? 
MR. COLDWELL.  Well, we just add another 
item that the Desk is going to have fight 
between M1 and M2, the federal funds rate, and now nonborrowed reserves. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Plenty of intellectual talent that in-- 

MR. COLDWELL.  I understand that, but I™m a 
little resistant to the idea of giving them 
more elements of inconsistency to work with in
 a short-range period.  Over a longer range, if we use nonborrowed reserves in a monthly context and 
look at the Ms in a quarterly context, I can see this as being a valuable addition. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, may I respond to 
Governor Coldwell.  One thing that may 
have been neglected here is the subcommittee™
s recommendation that the Manager refrain, we 
really mean that, we [unintelligible] kind 
of look through [non]borrowed reserves to the aggregates.  It would be the [responsibility] of the staff to make these linkages between the 
[non]borrowed reserve range and the aggregates range the Committee decided it wanted.  And in 
this fashion we could at least pinpoint where the problems were.   
[If] the Desk [was unable] to get the [non]bo
rrowed reserve range because of the federal 
funds constraint, then the Committee would have fu
ll [unintelligible] fairly sharp path in the decision to make in the context of the national 
markets and what our instincts tell us is good for the economy and so forth.   
On the other hand, if the Desk did hit the [non]borrowed reserve target within the federal funds constraint, but we weren™t getting the end results that we wanted on the aggregates over some span of, say, three or four months, then th
e staff would have to reexamine its equations in 
relationship to what level of [non]borrowed reserves would achiev
e the aggregates [target] over some span of months.  And I think that™s one real
 advantage of this proposal over the system that 
we have now.  We can™t quite tell whether it™s 
a federal funds constraint, or the multiplier, or 
what it is that™s causi
ng us to miss our target. 
3/29/76 - 34 -  
MR. COLDWELL.  Is this workable? MR. HOLMES.  Well, Governor Coldwell, let 
me make that simply a very concrete 
observation.  And I want Peter to make sure that 
I say this correctly.  As of last Friday, we had M1 and M2 right in the middle 
of the Committee™s two-month target.  And if we had had a 
nonborrowed reserves target, and if we had constructed a [reserves] path correctly--I had many 
problems in making sure that we™ve constructe
d a proper path--we would have been called upon to tighten the money market, let the funds rate 
go up.  Now is that really what the Committee 
wants?  What I thought the Committ
ee was really interested in is the aggregates, admitting that we can™t judge where we really are. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Why would you have had to tighten, Alan? MR. HOLMES.  Because we would have been well outside our nonborrowed reserves path 
as best we know how to draw it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I see, you™re sure of that? MR. HOLMES. Do I have it right? 

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Not sharply higher, but moderately higher, it-- MR. AXILROD.  Well, there™s room for disput
e in all this.  I think you are going to get projections differences between the Desk and the Board™s staff in all of this, as you do now.  And looking back at that period, it looked like we didn™t change the federal funds rate.  Your average nonborrowed reserves would have been $100 million 
higher over the five-week period than the 
target level we constructed.  On the subcomm
ittee™s guideline, plus or minus $50 million, that 
hadn™t been widened, [so] the Desk would have the choice of tightening up a little bit now or waiting awhile in order to see if maybe, with a li
ttle luck, our required reserves would drop later.  So, while, [on a] literal reading early in the peri
od we might want to tighten up a tick, it would 
also [be an] option to wait another week or s
o.  And by [that] time [if] you were still $100 
million off on your projections, then
 you might not have very much option left if the range were 
still plus or minus $50 million. 
MR. WALLICH.  Is there a possibility that if 
you waited a little while it might turn out that 
the aggregates would in fact begin to move in the direction in 
which the overshoot error in the nonborrowed reserves suggested that they would go? MR. AXILROD.  That™s the question of judgment, but the aggregates projection was 
actually below the midp
oints of the ranges. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLKER.  But literally, if I understand the subcommittee™s recommendation properly, Alan shou
ldn™t even have been looking at M1 or M2.  All he knows is that [non]borrowed reserves is above the targets so he should have been acting. MR. JACKSON.  I have [unintelligible] knows that your projections for M1 may just 
happen to accidentally hit the midpoint, 
which will lead you to future error. 3/29/76 - 35 -  
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, what is the theory of the subcommittee? 
[Unintelligible], forget about M1 
and operate on [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, that may be 
the theory of the subcommittee.  I asked 
Mr. Holland to advise us where he would like to [come] out.  He made no such 
recommendations. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Th
is is the ultimate, the-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t want to debate ultimates because I don™t know whether we 
will even go to the first step.  The Board [of Governors] still has a meeting, and we™ll have a 

difficult meeting.  We™ll have to bring this FOMC 
meeting to a conclusion very soon and I™d like 
to come out with some decisions.  Now let me, u
nder 4a, make this sugges
tion and see if it™s at all agreeable to the members of the Committee.  Let™s accord RPD a decent burial, and a decent 

burial would be to publish an article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin
 reviewing our experience 
with RPD, and why we consider it a failure, and th
en review some of the studies that we™ve been 
making of other reserves measures and indicate 
that there are other reserve measures that are 
more attractive, perhaps particularly nonborrowed reserves, and stop at that point as far as A is concerned.  I give you that as a target to shoot 
at, to accept or to reject.  Does that suggestion 
make reasonably good sense to the Committee? 
MR. JACKSON.  How much time? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well how long would it take to prepare such an article, Steve? MR. AXILROD.  I think it would take at a mini
mum two months or more.  I think it would 
have to be very carefully worded.  I believe you would have to face the problem, Mr. Chairman, 

of why we missed the RPD targets.  And I thin
k to a great extent it would be because the 
evidence would show that the Committee chose to 
adhere to the federal funds rate constraint 
rather than the RPD target. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t think so, call the shots as you see them and as the facts are. 
MR. AXILROD.  What the evidence will show-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That isn™t necessarily 
a criticism of the Committee--in fact, that 
may be evidence of the Committee™s practical wi
sdom.  But you™ll have to write it up in an 
objective spirit and not suggest that the Committ
ee failed because of its federal funds rate constraint, and be neutral as between that and between or sugg
esting that it acted wisely. Mr. 
Gramley. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Mr. Chairman, suppose one took 
a very cold, hard, objective look at the RPD experiment and said there never was one. 
 The Committee was fooling itself from the 
beginning, that any significant realistic experiment would have re
quired much larger variations in the federal funds rate than the Co
mmittee was ever willing to tolerate-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, all right, this is what-- 
3/29/76 - 36 -  
GRAMLEY.  --which I take it is a view that 
most academic critics have taken.  This is 
very difficult to write up in print. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Now let me ask you this question.  Can we bury RPD 
without an explanation? MR. GRAMLEY.  I would be inclined to sugge
st a minimal kind of explanation.  I think 
the explanation that you™re suggesting would be too revealing if it were written in up in a fairly 
honest, candid fashion. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I–I honestly have a very good conscience about all of this, and I think that is true of the whole Committee. 
MR. PARTEE.  The problem I have with it, Mr
. Chairman, is that once you admit that the 
RPD wasn™t hit because of federal funds rate constraints--well-intentioned, proper policy as it was--then you would have to conclude that no other reserve aggregate w
ould be any better than RPD.  That is, I don™t know how you keep from saying [unintelligible] about reserves. 
MR. MORRIS.  I think you can make the argum
ent, Chuck, that the difference lies in the 
ability of the Manager to control-- MR. PARTEE.  Not with a federal funds rate co
nstraint, he has no better ability to control it. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, I want to 
move along.  Drop that suggestion about an 
article in the 
Federal Reserve Bulletin and let me suggest that we just drop [RPD] and not say 
anything about it.  I™m going to th
e other extreme now.  First is a full scientific explanation in a 
scientific journal; the second is a very quiet death, we say nothing about it, we drop it. MR. PARTEE.  Maybe a paragraph in the Record of Policy Actions. MR. BROIDA.  That™s what I was going to s
uggest, Mr. Chairman.  We mentioned it in 
the Record of Policy Actions this time; we coul
d simply omit it and indicate that the Committee 
had decided to stop setting two-month ranges fo
r RPD and be more eclectic with respect to 
reserve measures. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, 
does that suggestion meet with
 the--let™s have a show of hands from the members of-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  May I make a comment first. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, please. 

MR. COLDWELL.  A question, I guess.  Why 
do you want to bury it today rather than 
wait till we have a substitute?  What does the difference of another few months carrying on a 

nonexistent or a noneffective [unintellig
ible] after you™ve done it for a year? 
3/29/76 - 37 -  
MR. JACKSON.  Let me speak to this, Mr. Ch
airman, because I raised this point several 
months ago.  It makes me extraordinarily uncomfo
rtable to tell the public that we are watching some measures or a relationship when in fact it™s 
a lie, and I just hate to see us do it.  I™d rather see us do the wrong thing and tell the public the truth than perhaps to do the right thing and lie about it. MR. COLDWELL.  Well then 
what you have to say is-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What you™ve said I think is entirely accurate
, but it™s not a lie 
we™ve had.  You know, we™re traditionalists-- MR. JACKSON.  Excuse me, that perhaps wa
s an overstatement, we don™t say things so 
directly [unintelligible] we say things more subtly. 
MR. WALLICH.  Federal Reserve [unintelligible] everything. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I don™t think there™s been any lying.  It™s been just a failure, you know we™re just a tradition-bound group, and it™s been a failure 
to recognize that, and I think it™s negligence on our part rather than anything else.  But I™m quarreling with you on your language, not on your thought.  There I have to be with you.  Well, let™s face it, let™s have a show of hands, do we drop now, say at the next meeting, 
with such a paragraph in the Record of Policy Actions, or do we wait a few months as Mr. Cold
well suggested.  The first suggestion is A, the second is B.  Let™s have a show of hands of those who favor A. SPEAKER(?). This is drop now, Mr. Chairman? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Just those who are voting yes, members of the Committee. 
MR. BROIDA.  Seven, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think the majo
rity of the Committee would favor that.  
Next we have the [unintelligible], what do we 
say, if anything, about nonborrowed reserves at 
this time?  Now, let me make a suggestion on that
.  [We could] indicate 
in the Record of Policy Actions that we are experimenti
ng with various other measures of reserves and as yet have not 
reached a conclusion as to which is the op
timal measure.  Would that be acceptable? 
MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, would that be 
in the same context, the same paragraph 
related to the-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Same paragraph, or 
a sentence or two in the immediately 
following paragraph. MR. EASTBURN.  Would the pub
lic interpret that as if 
they were in that close 
relationship, that you were actually substitu
ting when indeed we have not so agreed? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we can word it so as to avoid that kind of confusion, that kind of interpretation. 3/29/76 - 38 -  
MR. EASTBURN.  Okay. MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, we really have
 experimented a lot with reserve measures, 
and I think among reserve measures there is 
some preference for nonborrowed reserves.  We 
could at least hint that that™s what we™re thinking about. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s first take
 the narrower sentence 
or paragraph as I suggested it, and then we™ll add your thought.  How many would fa
vor doing that in the Record of Policy Actions, indicating that we have been studying and are continuing to study other measures of reserves for possible use in our ope
rations at the Desk?  Simply a sentence along 
those lines. MR. BROIDA.  Nine, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Now, next, let™s consider Governor Wallich™s suggestion, which is to add a further phrase to the effect that nonborrowed reserves appears to be perhaps the best of these measures but not say th
at it is or that we™re adopting it.  How many 
would favor such an additional sentence? MR. BROIDA.  Four. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, then, we don™t do that at the present time.  And we can do 
that, you know, at the next meeting or--now 
under B in the 4A in our agenda, emphasis on 
reserves as compared with monetary aggregates.   
Now let me ask this, Mr. Holland, whether it wo
uld serve and be entirely in harmony with 
the recommendations of your subcommittee if we
 now agreed that at each meeting of the 
Committee, the Manager would indicate how we
 might have fared if he had relied on 
nonborrowed reserves completely or in part.  And 
we do that for several months when he gives his report on operations at the Desk--that at the end of that repo
rt he takes a minute or two to 
indicate what might have happened if he ha
d paid more attention to nonborrowed reserves. MR. HOLMES.  Actually we have been doi
ng that for many months in the report-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But you have not been reporting-- MR. HOLMES.  --but not at the Committee meetings. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™ve not been reporting to the Committee.  Now is that in 
harmony with your suggestion?  Your second suggestion? 
MR. HOLMES.  Oh, yes. 

MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, do you also wa
nt us to include an appendix in the Bluebook giving the nonborrowed reserve measures
 that might be consistent with the 
alternative-- 
3/29/76 - 39 -  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That certainly was Governor Holland™s suggestion, the suggestion of his subcommittee, and I think that would give us all something to study before we come to the 
meeting. 
MR. AXILROD.  --plus their relations to other reserve measures--plan to include their 
relation to total reserves and the base? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, as to the scope of that appendix, at this stage we ought to leave that to the staff without 
putting fences around them.  Is that acceptable to the Committee?  
Let™s have a show of hands. 
MR. BROIDA.  Eleven, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Now as to the federal funds rate constraint, I would suggest to the Committee that we do nothing about 
that at this time until we learn more about 
this--let our thinking mature as to the federal f
unds rate constraint--and operate as we have been operating.  By that I don™t mean that we do what we
 did the last time, but that each time we reach 
our best judgment as to what the 
federal funds rate range ought to be, and that we not try at this meeting to decide they ought to be wider or narr
ower.  We™ll leave that 
question open.  Is that suggestion acceptable to the Committee? 
MR. BROIDA.  Looks unanimous, Mr. Chairman. 

MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, on that score how
 much do we really know about the impact 
of small changes in rates on economic activity
 and how much of th
is [unintelligible]? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the worst part of
 it is that we have a lot of private methodology, individual methodology. 
MR. PARTEE.  The small changes are cumulative. 

MR. HOLLAND.  The subcommittee has been 
unable to produce objective empirical 
evidence on that, Willis.  That™s one to which we
 hope to turn.  At the moment, we™re operating 
under conviction, personal conviction, that too much short-term 
bounce in interest rates hurts. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, gentlemen, I don™
t know how Mr. Holland feels about this meeting or [how] the other members of this Co
mmittee [feel] but I think we™ve made some real 
progress.  How do you feel, Mr. Holland? 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, I regret your re
moving RPD and not putting nonborrowed 
reserves in its place.  I think the Committee is 
going to suffer from that vacancy because I think 
it™s hard enough for the Committee to move ahead 
as it is without taking that.  And I™m afraid 
you™ll produce a little public reaction to the fact that we are now not using reserves in any way as an operating instrument. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I thought that we all had the impression that the public pretty much knows that we™ve b
een paying no attention to it. 3/29/76 - 40 -  
MR. HOLLAND.  I think it™s only [with regard 
to] the market participants that you can use 
the verb ﬁknow.ﬂ 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, what about the economists that pay attention to money, do 
they think that we are using it effectively?  Henry, do 
you have an opinion on that? MR. WALLICH.  Well, I think we will get a cr
iticism from the monetarists for dropping it, 
whether they think that
 it™s useful or not. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Look, we™ve got criticism from the monetarists no matter what we 
do.  It™s their destiny to criticize, it™s their place in life. MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, as I underst
ood the earlier agreemen
t, it was that the Record of Policy Actions would say that the Committee was cons
idering a variety of reserve 
measures and experimenting and wa
s to decide which was the best. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think you ought to say the staff has been studying that intensively, and you might even list
, that is, indicate the range that the staff is considering.  I think, Bob, your concern is over the possibility that we may forget about nonborrowed reserves.  
That™s the way I interpreted your comment. MR. HOLLAND.  No, I think the Committee woul
d pay a little more attention if it is 
bumped again, that™s true.  But 
my larger concern is that how we may appear to outside groups. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, out
side people are ready to leap in, they know all the answers and we™re not that smart.  Now, I do thin
k that because Alan has now assumed a definite 
obligation to the Committee--t
he report on nonborrowed reserves; what difference specific attention to that would have made; operations of
 the Desk; and assuming that obligation at every 
meeting henceforth--the Committee is not 
going to forget about nonborrowed reserves. MR. HOLLAND.  No, I think that™s true.  I thin
k we could also ask the staff to do a quick review of what Alan has said in that fashion in the last eight or 
10 months or so that he™s been 
sticking a word or two in his report.  And 
you can get a chance to see how his observations accumulated over a number of months, which might be helpful. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, unless a member of
 the Committee wants to raise any other 
question, I think we™re ready to adjourn. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The staff will inform us about at least one and I hope 
two things--how these equations look extended over a longer time period and how the present 
model would look if you were operating on forecast of GNP instead of [unintelligible]. 
SPEAKER(?). Right, we™v
e noted that in-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, then, I think that Mr. Balles™s suggestion about the somewhat longer time span of a few months ought
 to be explored pretty thoroughly, and that ought to come before the Committee before too long. 
3/29/76 - 41 -  
MR. AXILROD.  I had a tabulation prepared on certain noted measures.  I was not able to 
work this four-month to the average, as yet.  
I could expand that and make that available at a 
later point. 
MR. BALLES.  Then we™ll be getting an analysis of lagged reserves.  Is that coming out 
too? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, as Steve indicate
d earlier, this will come before the Board 
before the month is over. MR. AXILROD.  Before four weeks is up. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Three or four 
weeks from now, I think more so. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr
. Chairman, this is a parting shot here--maybe this 
will make you feel a little better 
about the report.  Certainly [speaking] for myself, and I think on 
behalf of the other members of 
the subcommittee, I can give you 
categorical assurance that there 
is not a monetarist in the group. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that fills me with d
eep regret.  I™d like to see a monetarist in 
the group.  It™s hard to live in this world...  But I think that we  owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. 
Holland, and to his colleagues--Governor Wallic
h, Mr. Morris, Mr. Balles--who worked with 
him and also to our staff, who have worked very diligently, very imaginatively on this problem 

for a good many months now.  Well, thank you.
