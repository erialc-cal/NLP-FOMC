November 16, 1976 
 
 [Executive session] 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  [Two items] I thought it be
st to take up in executive session.  One is to discuss a little [unintel
ligible] the Mexican situation and what [unintelligible] the 
subcommittee of this Committee has 
been up to.  And the second item that I wish to discuss with 
the [Committee] is Mr. Reuss™s request for th
e minutes of Reserve Bank board meetings.   
Now let me say a little about the Mexican situ
ation and then call on Mr. Wallich to talk to 
you about developments there and our own relation to
 those developments, and perhaps in detail.  
As you may recall, we have a sw
ap facility for Mexico.  Mexico can draw on us for up to $360 million; such a drawing was made earlier this ye
ar, and that amount was later repaid, or repaid recently.  The original loan to Mexico of $360 m
illion was not made by us with due deliberation, 
with due care.  We acted, I thi
nk, a little mechanically.  There was this arrangement, they asked 
for the money, and we asked a few questions, grumbl
ed a little, and just went along.  The fact of 
the matter is that we are very poorly informed
 about Mexico™s financial condition, and I™m not 
proud of the way in which we have conducted ourselves.  I™m not talking about the decisions.  I™m talking about the degree of knowledge, the am
ount of information we 
had at the time we 
made the decision.   
Since then, we have taken strong steps to fa
miliarize ourselves not only with the situation 
in Mexico on a current basis but to keep up-to-date records, as thorough as we can make them, 
for each of the countries with which we have
 a swap arrangement.  And we are far better 
organized today to deal with a request for a loan or a swap drawing than we were previously.   There was a time when swap drawings were virt
ually automatic.  Our at
titude has changed; mine certainly has.  When Britain came in earlier 
this year, the initial request was for $3 billion.  Without going through the details, I agreed with
 the British on the sum of $2 billion and 
indicated we would not go above that.  And then I went to the Treasury and asked the Treasury to become our partner, the reason being that Britai
n is no longer as creditworthy as it once was.  And I™m afraid that is the kind of world we live
 in as far as foreign borrowing from us--much of 
it--is concerned.  We have not 
said anything about that publicly, and I don™t think we should.  We would only add to anxiety and uncertainty.  But I no longer regard the swap facility as being quasi-automatic.  I don™t think it should be.   Now, I haven™t found anyone who anticipated a depreciation of the Mexican peso of 50 percent or more.  The financial policies conducted by that country have been scandalous--we were inadequately informed.  Well, we now und
erstand, I think, the situation in Mexico with reasonable thoroughness.  The Mexicans have now come in for a request for a new borrowing.  
That request was studied with the utmost care by
 your subcommittee.  We had one meeting after 
another on the issue, raised one question after another, one kind of conversation after another with the Mexicans, one conversation after another with the Treasury.  The long and short of it is that Mexico may be very close to bankruptc
y.  I mean by that the enormous foreign debts 
Mexico has contracted--it is by no means clear that
 Mexico will be able to service these debts, 
11/16/76 - 2 - 
    and a moratorium may need to be declared, [with
] the debts being rescheduled.  Now that would be a most unfortunate development because our banks
 are heavily involved in lending to Mexico.  
And of course it could set off mora
toria elsewhere around the world.   Taking things all and all, recognizing that Mexico is not a good borrower, recognizing that any amount that we might loan to Mexico may 
not be repaid for some time, the subcommittee 
still decided unanimously to make a loan of $150 
million and not go above that.  That is exactly 
what the Treasury has made available to the Mexican
s, so we™re being partners in that deal just 
as we were on the British case.  Now, you might 
wonder why would we make a loan in the case 
of a country the prospects of which are so gloomy 
and the prospects of which in any event are so highly uncertain?  The factor that 
led me finally to conclude that 
it was desirable, I believe--and other members of the subcommittee were governed 
by similar thoughts--was that if Mexico were 
to declare a moratorium in the near future, having
 received no help at all from this central bank, 
then we would inevitably share a certain responsi
bility for the collapse and for the difficulties 
that would be caused to our commercial banks.   
Now, if you ask me, am I at all sure that a 
loan of a $150 million by us would prevent such 
a default, the answer is, oh, no, by no means.  It
™s really a drop in the bucket, considering Mexico™s enormous need to borrow.  But a new government will come into power, and that, of 

course, influenced our thinking to a degree.  And 
if a reflow of capital took place, Mexico could 
straighten out its affairs; if a 
reflow doesn™t take place, then I 
am afraid Mexico will go down the 
drain.  Now I am going to call on Mr. Wallich to a
dd to my comments in any way he sees fit. 
MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, I don™t think th
ere™s a great deal I can add to what you say.  You™ve adequately, accurately described the situation of Mexi
co.  Going into a little more 
detail, they have moved into a period of uncerta
inty about the exchange rate after many years in 
which it was taken for granted that the exchange rate was stable.  As a result, there developed in Mexico a great degree of ease of moving betwee
n dollars and pesos; there is no exchange control, people can maintain dollar deposits in Me
xican banks, they can take their dollars out of the country, of course.   This system, once stability has been abandone
d, becomes very troublesome.  The dollars 
deposited in Mexican banks can be sent abroad very easily, or they can be withdrawn in currency.  That™s the reason why we have these heavy currency shipments to Mexico.  It™s a form 
of capital flight that is difficult to manage by mean
s of interest rate policy.  Interest rate policy affects the corporate borrower, but it is not, on the whole, the corporat
e borrower who is taking his money out of Mexico; it™s 
the individual who has dollar deposits, or even has peso savings, and cashes those in and buys dollars.   Now, in the face of that, the Bank of Mexico, in my opinion, has trie
d far too long and far 
too hard to hold up the rate.  The Fund [IMF] told them at the beginning of the negotiations that 
led to the last agreement--the 
Fund has had three missions there 
this year--the Fund told them 
that they had concluded that a 50 percent depreciation would be needed.  The initial depreciation was much less than that.  They held the rate at th
is level, which cost about $1 billion of reserves.  Finally, they had to let go and went to what is, in effect, close to 50 percent depreciation.  The peso used to be 8 cents, and now it is around 4.  Even then, the Mexican central bank has tried to manage the rate and convey a sensation of upwar
d trend in order to reduce the capital flight.  
11/16/76 - 3 - 
    They have invested less money in this effort than before, but they needed additional reserves, and that is one reason for the drawing.   The other reason for the drawing on Treasury and the Federal Reserve is that they need 
compensating balances.  They typically keep 1.2 b
illion to 1.6 billion of compensating balances 
with their various banks--these are their excha
nge reserves.  Now these are down into the low hundreds [of millions].  The Treasury examined th
e possibility of a swap that would give the 
Mexicans only compensating balances that they
 couldn™t in effect draw out, but it was abandoned because it would create legal problems, a
nd there are no particular strings attached to 
either the Treasury™s or our drawing.   
We had, in the new drawing that was agreed, a sharp cutback from the original level of the 
swap.  That level remains as being a general au
thorization, but then in this particular case, instead of 360, we said a limit of 150.  This they 
were to take down in two tranches of 75 each, the second one to occur after they had secured a loan from Bank of America, which is being 
negotiated--800 million--and which, according to re
ports from the Mexicans, is being signed 
today.  So that would create the conditions in which the second drawing could be made.  The 
first drawing was made right after the agreement.   
We had a new wrinkle in this swap, which gives us a little added protection, although I would caution not to overrate it.  They had to agree to a maintenance-of-value clause.  If the 
peso, which fluctuates in the market, should 
go down during the period of the 90-day drawing, then, in the first place, they™re expected to repay; but second, if it is [mutually] agreed not to 
repay, to extend the swap. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean repa
y at the end of three months. MR. WALLICH.  Three months.  But if we agree th
at it is to be rolled over, and if the peso has depreciated at that time, th
ey have to put in additional pesos so that the dollar value of collateral is maintained.  In the 
back of this there is the thought--which I am sure is obvious to 
them, although we have not made it overt--that we 
could go into their market and sell these pesos 
for what they would bring.  Now this, of course, could [unintelligible] by blocking this account, and it is a thing that we would hardly do except in extremes, but the fact that they would have to 
take further action to keep us from doing so, I th
ink, will slightly weight 
the scales in their mind 
in favor of doing what they can to meet their 
obligation.  The Treasury tried to get a similar 
arrangement into their swap, but 
they found again the legal problems defeated them, so they are 
going without this little added protection.   Now as to the future, the Chairman has desc
ribed the situation.  A new government is 
coming in, and the President is a former finan
ce minister.  It is hoped that he will inspire 
confidence.  His views are not 100 percent known, and there is some apprehension even that they 
might lean in the direction of the agricultural 
reform, and other things, that would certainly not 
add to confidence.  The Fund thinks that the situation is manageable if they
 decide to do the right things, that is, cut down government expenditures 
and keep wages from rising unreasonably.  On 
both fronts, so far, they have not performed very well.  The g
overnment deficit looks as if it 
might be larger than expected and will have to
 be renegotiated with the Fund to preserve the 
standby.  On wages, the increases were larger than were seemingly agr
eed with the IMF.   11/16/76 - 4 - 
    Other than that, there is as yet no obvious impe
diment to the continued viability of Mexico.  
They claim that this $800 million 
loan, negotiated after the devalu
ation, was oversubscribed.  It™s 
being signed apparently on schedule, to the date that they have said, although they™re getting the money a little later than they had led us to believe.  They have not yet negotiated for next year, on the ground that when one is negotiating one big loan, one must not be negotiating something 
else.  They do have to borrow something on the order of $250 million a month, given that they 

will have something like, at best, a $2 billion cu
rrent account deficit, and ought to restore their reserves by about a billion.  That does not yet allow for any reflows.  If they get reflows, their situation will be very materially improved.  To
tal outflows just during this year were roughly guessed to have been at $2-1/2 billion.  So very large Mexican amounts abroad could come back 
if there™s confidence of great profit in pesos to the owners, and it depends entirely on the attitude of the new government. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much.  Th
ere is one additional word that I™d like 
to say before exposing myself and Mr. Wallic
h and other members of the subcommittee to 
questioning.  These conversations with Mexico were practically concluded by Sunday evening, 
November 7.  On the morning of November 8, we [the FOMC] had a telephone conference, at 

which time we took up our longer-range monetary ta
rgets--the subject on which I had to testify on the 11th.  Therefore it would have been possible for me to take up this subject of the Mexican 
loan on the morning of November 8 
with members of the Committee.   
Now, I thought long and hard about that.  It certainly would have been my intention, my 
strong preference.  But this is such a highly sensitive subject, and I™m told that our telephone 
hookup is not absolutely secure.  Therefore, I deci
ded that if any leak occurred, it could cause great convulsions that would cause waves all around the world, and I decided therefore not to do 
it.  Now your subcommittee met continuously, with
 the exception of Mr. Volcker, who was out 
of the country part of the time.  Mr. Volcke
r was fully informed, and the subcommittee was 
entirely unanimous, but I did want you to know that
 this technically could have come before the 
Committee at the meeting on the 8th and my
 reason for not bringing it up [then]. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  A clarification:  $150 million [from the] Federal Reserve and $150 
[from the] the Treasury? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s right. MR. KIMBREL.  Any magic in those numbers that they arrived at? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, no magic--hard bargai
ning.  We started out being reluctant to 
do anything, but afterward, you know, [in] our own discussions [with the Treasury]--the attitude 
of the Treasury, taking into account repercussions on the world at large, on our own banks, the position that we would be in if we ignored entirely the difficulty of another central bank--the Treasury previously reached this agreement of 
150 and indicated [to us] that they would be receptive to--in view of the possi
ble consequences--increasing thei
r loan.  We went along with a 
150 and indicated to the Mexicans that we don™t have any intention of going beyond that.  Mr. MacLaury. 
11/16/76 - 5 - 
    MR. MACLAURY.  As I remember our last spot 
takeout--in fact, for a short time, at least, 
it was the ESF--the Exchange Stabilization Fund--that took us out.  Were they then funded by a 
drawing on the IMF?  Is that the sequen
ce of events, that™s, in other words-- MR. WALLICH.  The Mexicans paid us
; it might have gone the other way. 
MR. MACLAURY.  But it didn™t go that way, and 
at the moment, what is the status of the 
Mexican ability to draw on the IMF?  Can we l
ook to that as a takeout this time around, or are 
we on a limb? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We have ma
de no such condition this time. 
MR. WALLICH.  The effect of doing that is
 the Mexicans are going to get $235 [million] 
a year for three years from the Fund.  The first year, 1977, the Treasury is going to prefinance in tranches of three pieces again, not the next two y
ears, so there is nothing for us to get our teeth 
into. 
SPEAKER(?).  Mr. Chairman, what is the 
extent of the exposure of the commercial banking industry in this country? 
 That™s something you mentioned. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t have the figure in mind--$8 billion, I think. 
MR. WALLICH.  I think it™s a little
 over, I think it™s 9, close to 9. SPEAKER (?).  So this is 
merely a drop in the bucket? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you see, their borrowing needs as best we can judge are about $250 [million] per month. 
MR. PARTEE.  Do they remain in debt to th
e Treasury for that earlier, what was it, $300 
[million]? 
MR. WALLICH.  That was repaid out of the IMF. 

MR. PARTEE.  So that all the debt to the Un
ited States officially [will be] this 300, and we 
have indicated to them that they can™t use any of
 the remaining part of the swap.  Is that right? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, Henry and I had the initial conversations, and Henry carried on a conversation later on.  My understanding is that that™s what you communicated to the Mexicans.  Would you answer that question precisely? MR. WALLICH.  They were told that 
we wouldn™t go over 150 even though the swap remained at its original level of 360, and it™s gear
ed to be the same as to the Treasury; that™s 
because the Treasury went to 150. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Henry, who are the banks be
sides Bank of America, Citicorp--I don™t 
mean by name, not many, not at all. 
11/16/76 - 6 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  All I can tell you is that th
e bank that usually heads syndicates with them did not do it, and that™s how
 Bank of America got into it. 
MR. COLDWELL.  You don™t know how 
many other banks are involved? 
MR. WALLICH.  No, I don™t.  I was told 
by them that it was oversubscribed, which suggests that it was more than a very
 small number, but I can™t tell you. 
MR. PARDEE.  It™s a goodly number, I think 10 or a dozen. MR. COLDWELL.  I understood there™s a numbe
r of regional banks waiting in the wings to participate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There are plenty of sheep in this country. 
SPEAKER(?).  Is this $9 billion all governme
nt debt, I mean to the Mexican government? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh, no, their total debt, total known indebtedness is well over 20 billion.  That is known indebtedness abroad. SPEAKER (?).  I™m thinking of the American banks. 

MR. WALLICH.  To American banks [uni
ntelligible,] in part government, part 
nationalized enterprises, 
and part private enterprises.  In Mexico, the proportion of private borrowers out of total Mexican foreign indebtedne
ss is particularly high because it™s that kind of 
a country. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me call on Mr. Gard
ner, Mr. Gardner may want to comment, 
and then, I know, [Mr.] Volcker. MR. GARDNER.  Well, my only comments, ge
ntlemen--you have heard a complete 
review of the conditions surrounding the request.  I™ll only attempt to again put it in a time and 
schedule structure.  It™s early November.  We know there 
is a negotiation going on for $800 million credit.  We know also that Mexico must 
begin rolling over and arranging for rollovers for 
this enormous amount of credit th
ey already have outstanding in our country and internationally.  The Echeverría government goes out of office on 
December 1.  The IMF conditions which were 
so carefully drawn do not go into effect until January 1.  The tourist season in Mexico begins on November 15.  The U.S. foreign policy position as
 expressed by the Treasury is one in which they very clearly indicated they would like us to consider whether or not we could do something 
with them, move [unintelligible] the Administra
tion for foreign policy consideration.  So we end up with a small, carefully cons
tructed interim bit of aid. 
MR. PARTEE.  Interim? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We
ll, that™s uncertain. 
MR. GARDNER.  Well, 90 days. 11/16/76 - 7 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  That™s awfully important, I th
ink, because of the comparison with the U.S. 
situation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I must say I hope it™s inte
rim, but if this turned out to be one of 
these loans that stretches out uncomfortably, I 
would not to be too surprised, unfortunately, under the circumstances. 
MR. GARDNER.  I agree, I understand Governor Partee™s comment.  My point was probably poorly expressed.  This amount of swap under our regular and some special conditions 
is a very small part--as has alrea
dy been expressed here--of the external inde
btedness of Mexico.  It seemed to me, as a member of the subcommittee, quite wise to proceed in this small, cautious 

way with the schedule that I have outlined for you.  And the earnest hope [is] that a new 

government headed by a former finance minister, 
the IMF conditions and their further drawings 
as Henry has described, and--as we all know now--a further depreciation in the peso, give Mexico a fighting chance to manage this situati
on without an official moratorium.  I think that 
persuaded me that it was important for us to be
 a part, or a small part, of this picture. MR. COLDWELL.  Was there a co
nsideration that our participation as an official body might have encouraged 
other people to lend? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, no; oh no.  But, well, we thought long and hard about that, and the last thing that we would have wanted to do or did do was to give Mexico a loan and have Mexico use that as a basis for borrowing from th
e commercial banks and therefore be indirectly 
responsible for drawing in the commercial banks.  We did not fall into any such trap.   
Now, we could have gotten, for example, also an agreement out of the Mexicans--I think 
this would have been easy--under which, ge
tting 800 million or 800 million plus from the 
commercial banks now, they would use some of that
 money to repay us.  We talked about that, 
but we didn™t have to spend much time debating th
at.  That would have put us in an impossible 
position, you see.  Here the other banks come in and we get our money back out of funds that 
they supplied.  I don™t think a central bank can ever put itself in that position.  So we could have secured our loan, but we decided not to.   One other point--possibly you covered that, Henry, I know I didn™t--we have reemphasized 
repeatedly to the Mexicans that they must us
e the funds supplied very sparingly and in the process of foreign exchange transactions, and they must not try to
 peg the peso, that they must 
husband their resources.  We have all kinds of assurances from the Mexicans that they will do 

just that.  These assurances were made initially 
voluntarily.  They have re
peated those assurances 
as we raised the question, but having said that, I must go on to say that my confidence in these assurances being respected is very limited.  A
nd my confidence in their central bank operations is very limited.   
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes. 

MR. MAYO.  Where does this, what is our posi
tion in relationship to the supervision of 
our domestic commercial banks if we have a f
eeling such as you just expressed?  Do we, 
11/16/76 - 8 - 
    policywise--is this related in any way to our me
mber banks in order to avoid a possible problem 
that they might have if there were a de
bt moratorium on the credit extended?   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now let me talk about that
 just a little in a more comprehensive or 
rather a more general way.  We could advise th
e banks strongly to cut back on their foreign lending.  If we did that, we run the risk [of] the very crisis in international finance that we are seeking to prevent.  I™m not talking about 
Mexico, I™m talking about all around, because our 
banks have, in my judgment, been
 rather imprudent once again in 
lending abroad.  That is my 
judgment; I may be wrong about that, but that™s the wa
y I feel.  If we gave them strong advice to 
that effect, we could bring on an international financial crisis.  On the other hand, if they continue lending on the scale that [they] have been doing, then I think it™s only a matter of time 
before such a crisis will occur.   
Now, what I have done, really, well, let me go back.  [IMF Managing Director] Mr. 
Witteveen issued a word of warning, and that was 
done after consultation with us.  He issued his word of warning in Manila, which you may have 
seen.  [Treasury Secretary] Mr. Simon did the same, and that was done after careful consultatio
n with us.  In some meetings with private 
bankers, I tried to deal with the question lightly and indicated this
 is an area that bankers must 
consider carefully.   
I thought about taking stronger measures, but 
here is the difficulty.  There are two difficulties.  The one that I just mentioned, namely 
that they might take th
at advice too strictly 
and then bring on a crisis.  But there is a second difficulty:  If we start telling banks publicly just to whom to lend, for what purpose to lend, we 
would be getting into the business of credit allocation.  And you may recall the 
difficulties we had with the Congress in connection with the 
REITs.  We did a little of that and all hell br
oke loose on Capitol Hill, the point being, well, now you are in the credit allocation business now, and 
what™s wrong with the credit allocation bill 
that has been submitted.   
So we have been quite cautious.  I don™t know if that is--it™s as good a reply as I can make 
to the question.  I would not want to say, and I have never said to anyone, to answer your question specifically, that banks should not lend to Mexico.  I haven™t singled out Mexico.  I have talked generally about the LDCs, and honestly, in the world th
at we live in, the category of LDCs badly needs redefinition, in my judgment.  
Great Britain and Italy in today™s world belong 
in a category of LDCs for every practical financial purpose.  Yes, Mr. Eastburn. MR. EASTBURN.  I have heard some talk that
 the peso may now be undervalued.  Is this 
optimistic? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I rather think it is [undervalued].  But the way in which they have been handling their wage problems also ma
kes me wonder how long that condition will 
continue. MR. WALLICH.  I think that is an accurate
 assessment.  The Fund, surprisingly to me, 
concluded [that, in seeking a] 50 percent depreciation, at least 40 was what they needed.  They didn™t believe it.  They finally got it.  The 
price impulses are somewhat stronger than was 
anticipated, so the undervaluation is probably temporary. 11/16/76 - 9 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions? MR. BAUGHMAN.  Do we have an impression as
 to what the policy of the government or 
the central bank will be with respect to shor
ing up private business firms that find the 
devaluation places them in an
 untenable debt situation? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I, I don™t know the general-- MR. WALLICH.  Yeah, this was one of the 12 or
 13 points in the original program to take 
care of firms that were in that condition.  If
 they™re doing this, they are not doing it on a very generous scale, because one of the strong objections that are raised to further depreciation--for instance, one [wants to say] why don™t you let the rate go, let it find its own level--is the threat of 
bankruptcy to firms that owe dollars
 but have been invested in pesos.  How they got themselves 
into that position is the history of the last 12 years of stability, in which it was cheap to borrow in dollars and dear to borrow in pesos, and they did not properly as individual firms manage their 
exchange rate exposure. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Volcker, would you like to comment? 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don™t think I have anything to add specific to the Mexican situation other than reiterate a comment 
that has already been made, that Mexico is 
basically a country that could manage the situation if they are 
able to economicall
y.  It should be a manageable situation.  I do think what we™re se
eing here is the symptom of general strains and 
tensions around the world that are going to be di
fficult to manage.  They will be difficult in this 
case, they may be difficult in other cases, and I feel very strongly there is nothing we can walk away from.   
And we will be called upon from time to ti
me for this kind of difficult operation in 
Mexico--maybe there won™t be any 
others, but I suspect there could be.  It seems to me to be a 
very modest kind of effort on our part.  It™s got so
me risks, but the risks ar
e limited in view of the 
risks from the situation not being managed correctl
y.  I think we need to exert a little leverage 
here.  A little help from us from time to time, and this is a manifestation of it. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would second that comme
nt, that it™s a situation we can™t walk 
away from.  Now, I think you all know that the Br
itish have applied to the IMF, but the British are putting on a very powerful political campaign to accomplish two things.  First, no conditions 

by the IMF--in effect, have the IMF bless British financial policy.  Second, to work out some 
arrangement whereby the sterling 
balances--which, in the aggregate, amount to about $10 billion, 
but of which the sensitive part is held by central banks, and that part amounts to $4 
billion--would [be] somehow taken 
care of by other countries.   Now, this is a problem that has concerned me 
very deeply for some time.  In response to a 
direct question from the Bank of England, and in 
response to an emissary sent by other central 
banks and to Mr. Leaver, who is an emissary 
of the British government--Mr. Galagan and Mr. 
Leaver are seeing the President today--I have take
n a very hard position, saying that I, for one, 
will not even talk about the sterling balances unt
il the IMF arrangement has been concluded.  But 
while I have taken this very tough position in talking to the British--and a similar position, 

fortunately, I think, is being taken by the Treasury, and I™ve talked to the President about this, 11/16/76 - 10 - 
    both before the election and since then, and to others, Mr. Kissinger, etc.--while I™ve taken as tough a position as one could, internally some work
 is being done by our staff, and some of us 
are considering various possibilities, but we™ve not indicated even one word that this is happening.   In a very uncertain world, it is difficult--well,
 worse than difficult, I think it™s unwise to 
take a hard position and stick to it no matter what the probable or
 likely consequences may be.  I 
think that the New York City problem was in th
e end handled quite appropriately.  The position taken was, not one cent for New York.  And that position was repeated so often that New York 
City finally came to believe it.  New York C
ity, New York State started doing something by 
themselves to solve their problem.  In the end, 
some help was extended by the government, and I 
played a certain part in making that possible.  
But there was no hint ever given that help was going to be forthcoming, because we wanted New 
York to help itself as far as possible.   And that, I think, is our problem with the Br
itish today.  And there will be other problems 
around the world, as Mr. Volcker has indicated.  It™s in the nature of planning really.  You don™t plan for success.  Well, if success comes along you 
enjoy it.  It™s in the nature of good planning to try to think through how to prevent disaster; in other words, to make unfavorable assumptions 
and try to think through at as early a stage as possible how to prevent disaster, how to prevent the unfavorable event from occurring.  And I want 
this Committee to know that very careful thought 
is being given to the entire world scene.   Let me say one final word.  This meeting is 
an executive session.  I wanted to share my concerns with my colleagues, not only about th
e Mexican situation:  We™ve been actively at 
work and have been energizing this government 
to do something to prevent an increase in the 
price of oil.  What will come of
 it, I don™t know, but at last this 
government is awake.  Now, my 
advice to all of you, and I can™t put that too strongly, is to say as little as possible about any of these problems because they are so extremely sensitive. 
MR. WALLICH.  Could I make one comme
nt going back to Mexico?  The word 
ﬁmoratoriumﬂ has been used, and that is one 
way of describing something that might happen.  
The arrangements, however, that the Mexicans have
 in place in case one of their major units 
should be unable to roll over--and they™re all actively engaged in rolling over, during the last two months of the year, some $600 million or $800 milli
on of indebtedness--are that there would be a 
degree of central control so that one would not suddenly be confronted with sporadic nonpayment, but rather that it woul
d be possible to enter into negotiations so that what otherwise might be a moratorium would look more lik
e a rescheduling, and I guess would be a rescheduling.  This is something, of course, th
at has happened to other countries--Argentina has been rescheduled more than once; Brazil has 
been rescheduled repeatedly, and today these countries enjoy a great amount of credit.  So the world has not come to an end, because countries 
don™t come to an end when that happens.  Ther
e is a new situation with respect to what the accountants might do to reschedule loans today.  In
 that regard, we™re in a different ball game. 
MR. JACKSON.  Let™s don™t say ﬁenjoyﬂ that much
 credit; they just have that much credit.  
It™s an important difference. 
MR. WALLICH.  You get $25 billion credit. 
11/16/76 - 11 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  The way you put it Henry, it make
s me sympathetic with the position of 
the accountants. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question or comment on--  
MR. JACKSON.  Just how long do you think this will hold the Mexicans, if I could use 
that expression? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  My judgment is very simp
le.  If you have reflows of capital, this will all turn out very happily.  
If you don™t, I don™t see how a mora
torium or rescheduling can be 
prevented very long. MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I just might 
report that the qualitative types of thing that one picks up indicate that the uncertainty--and I guess I could even use the word ﬁtensionﬂ now--is still building up rather than
 leveling off with respect to 
the people who move across and 
do business across the border on a rather personal sort of basis.  There is coming into these 
conversations now hints of concern about personal security as well as financial security.  This comes to my mind in connection with the refere
nce to the possibilities of some agricultural 
reforms or something like that coming into th
e picture.  I heard reports, after the initial 
devaluation, of a number of 
people approaching border banks and inquiring as to whether they could borrow funds to take a speculative position in the peso.  I™ve not heard such reports following the further devaluation, notwithstanding the fact that the value™s a good deal lower now.  It may be that there™s less 
confidence in the current value than there was in the earlier one. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There is one item that 
will come up at our regular meeting that I 
think I should mention, and you correct if 
I™m wrong, Mr. Pardee.  I believe you will be 
recommending to the [FOMC] that the present swap schedule be reaffirmed. 
MR. PARDEE.  Right. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think we ought to reach that decision here, rather than in open, that is, at our formal meeting.  My own view is
 that we certainly ought to do that, but we ought to do that with the understanding that the swap facility no longer has the automatic meaning that 
it had previously.  For us not to reaffirm 
the present swap schedule would cast doubt and uncertainty and it could have very serious repercussions.  I think we definitely ought to reaffirm, 
but we ought to understand among ourselves that 
the swap facility no longer has quite the meaning that it did.  Now, actually, historicall
y, it never was completely automatic, but it is 
definitely less so now than before. MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, I think it™s 
getting increasingly understood in the world 
that the swap facilities are a fr
amework within which one negotiates, rather than an automatic 
drawing right, and to that extent I think your wishes are being met. 
 We have to bear in mind that 
we, too, draw on swaps, although on a very small scale, when we engage in open market 

operations, so that we wouldn™t want to build up the resistance, for instance, of the Germans, 
who usually ask questions or may put limits on wh
at we can draw.  We wouldn™t want to build 
that resistance up any more than we have to. 11/16/76 - 12 - 
    MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, 
my comments are similar to this type.  The question is, 
what does this mean in operationa
l terms--to make less automatic? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, in operational terms, what it means is that when a request 
comes along and we have doubts about the creditworthiness of the borrower, or we have doubts 

about the purpose of the borrowing, as in the Austrian case recently--you know, what the Austrians were doing, essentially, wa
s really arbitraging on interest rates, and I don™t see why we should lend money for that purpose.  What it means 
operationally is that we™re far more cautious, far more deliberate, as to country and 
as to purpose, than we used to be. MR. COLDWELL.  Are there elements in our 
present swap network which you believe are either unnecessary or undesirable? MR. PARDEE.  No, I think the swap arrangements, as they are set forth now, cover the 
ground well.  I think in the context of the recent 
experience we™ve had with Italy, Britain, and the Mexicans, we can, on a case-by-case basis, make 
the adjustments we need in swap arrangements 
to appropriate provisions at the time.  We have thought very carefully in New York that there 
might be some suggestion of changes in the swap
 arrangement itself, but at this stage I see no reason to do so.  Rather, I would prefer to continue it as now, on a case-by-case basis, to make 
determinations of conditions to fit the situation. 
MR. PARTEE.  Mexico is the only LDC member. 
MR. PARDEE.  And Britain and Italy. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, only-- 

MR. PARTEE.  Well, they™re not 
exactly overdeveloped countries. SPEAKER(?).  They™re not basket cases. 

SPEAKER(?).  Overdeveloped. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s a nice term. 

MR. COLDWELL.  We have no further reques
ts for drawings of swap arrangements? 
MR. PARDEE.  No, nothing formal at this
 stage.  Feelers from time-to-time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think we will be 
more circumspect about any such requests 
than we have been.  I was not enthusiastic at all, in fact resisted for some time, the request of the 
Mexicans to double the amount of 
the swap facility going up from $180 to $360.  Well, we did it, 
and that kind of resistance or that kind of question would be greater in the future, I assure you.  This isn™t a happy picture, gentlemen, not the best
 way to start our deliberations, but I felt that it™s only proper to advise the members of 
the Committee on what your subcommittee, and in 
certain areas, I myself, have been doing.   
11/16/76 - 13 - 
    Any further questions?  If not let me turn to 
the second item for this 
executive session, and that is the request that Mr. Reuss made some ti
me ago that we deliver to him by 5 p.m., October 
15, the minutes of all our Reserve Bank meetings for 
the past five years.  Now just before I went 
off on my foreign trip, I advise
d Mr. Reuss that I was going abroad, that it would be impossible to comply with the request by October 15, and that
 the matter is being explored with our Reserve 
Banks, and that I would be in touch with him s
oon after my return.  I had a meeting with Mr. 
Reuss and subsequently received a letter from him indi
cating his understanding of our conversation.  I would prefer not to go into detail on that and merely say that my understanding 
is not the same as Mr. Reuss™s understanding of 
that conversation.  Now, I have before me a 
letter that I haven™t yet 
sent, which I do intend to send today.  I™ll read this letter to you and then we can discuss that on whatever scale you wish.   Dear Henry: 
In accordance with our conversation last Friday, I sh
all advise the Reserve Bank boards to send you the 
minutes of their meetings. 
As you and I agreed at our meeting, the following highly sensitive items will be omitted:  those pertaining 
to borrowing or prospective borrowing by individually named banks at the discount window; those pertaining to 
transactions with foreign central banks; and those pertaining to real estate plans or negotiations in process.  Also, 

items pertaining to individual personnel matters or to safe
ty measures at the banks will be put in a separate file, 
and you and I alone will sit down and go over them.  Let me say once again that I am pleased that this matter has 
been resolved and that I shall do wh
at I can to expedite the delivery of the minutes for 1972, 1974, and 1975. 
Now I hope that this will end the ma
tter, but I cannot be entirely sure. MR. BLACK.  You omitted 1973, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well I omitted--I have thr
ee years here instead of five, you see.  I tried to persuade Mr. Reuss--really, since his purpose is apparently to see what the Reserve Banks do; it™s some kind of fishing expedition-
-that a one-year sample would probably serve his 
purpose.  If he finds that it doesn™t, well, he could come back and ask for another year.  We 
reached this compromise on three years instead of
 five, which will cut down the labor, since this 
editing process will be not a small burden for the Reserve Banks.   
Now, I tried to persuade Mr. Reuss to follow another course, namely that since his interest 
originally was on the question of
 how much control do the Reserv
e Banks and the directors of those Banks have over the Federal Reserve™s monetary policy--I 
thought that was his interest, and earlier correspondence did indicate that that was his interest--I tried to persuade him that that 
interest could be met quite adequately without
 turning to the Reserve Banks at all, and I indicated to him that I would be pleased to 
make available to him 
every communication from 
each of the Reserve Banks with respect to the di
scount rate; second, that I would make available 
to him all petitions that we receive from time 
to time from the boards of directors of individual 
Banks; and that I would be willing, further, to make available to him 
all letters that I had received from individual members 
of our Bank boards.  Mr. Reuss indicated that would not meet 
his need because his need was to determine what 
the Reserve Banks really do, and that he or his committee was entitled to that information.   
And then we turned to the expurgated minutes--that was the 
next point that I took up, the sensitive areas and how they™re to be dealt with.  Now, if all of this is acceptable to Mr. 
11/16/76 - 14 - 
    Reuss--which I devoutly hope will be the case-
-then at the time when these minutes are 
transmitted, I will express the hope 
that they will be treated conf
identially by his committee.  I 
don™t want to do that in this letter.  I don™t think this is the time to take up that question.   
I™d be glad to answer any questions about this at whatever length members of the 
Committee may wish.  I assure you that a great deal
 of thought and trouble has gone into this at the [Federal Reserve] Board™s end and my personal end, as well as
 at the individual Banks.  And if this agreement stands, I do think that it is 
a very reasonable and a very good resolution of a very difficult problem that unfortunately ha
s arisen, which need not have arisen.   Now, at some stage, I™m going to call 
on Mr. O™Connell to talk about technical arrangements with the Banks with regard to the u
nderstanding as described in the letter that I™ve just read to you.  But are there any questions first?  Yes, Mr. Winn. 
MR. WINN.  Obviously, this does no
t include Branch board minutes? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think the answer to th
at question is yes.  That question was not asked, and we™re not going to volunteer. MR. GUFFEY.  Are these being submitted to Mr. Reuss as chairman of the committee or 
as an individual congressman? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  These will be submitte
d, the letter will be addressed to ﬁThe 
Honorable Henry S. Reuss, Chairman.ﬂ SPEAKER(?).  Does he have the backing of hi
s committee?  Do we know
 that, or is it an 
individual request? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That has not been tested, and I thought that it would be far better to work something out with Mr. Reuss rather than subject this question to methodical testing, 
which would have created the spectacle, at least, of a confrontation, which would have seriously exacerbated feelings.  Whether he would have 
the backing of his committee or not on this 
question, I simply do not know.  What I can be sure
 of is that, if we refuse and ask for an expression by the entire committee, this would 
certainly be hotly debated, fought over, and no matter how the matter was resolved by 
the committee, scars would be left. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I don™t think 
this is a matter which I™d wa
nt to go into that kind of fight on, Mr. Chairman, but there may be some do
wn the road which I hope we would not accede 
to his request just as a chairman or a congressman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I can assure [you], first, that your judgment about the future 
is something I share--and your word of caution, I 
also share that feeling completely.  Yes, Mr. 
Morris. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, do we [unintelligib
le] just the bare minutes or [also the] 
supporting documentation and reports that w
ould be referred to in the minutes? 
11/16/76 - 15 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think this is one of the technical matters that Mr. 
O™Connell will take up with the officers of your Banks, and Mr. O™Connell will comment on that 
presently.  My own feeling is that the attachme
nts should not be, or need not be, submitted.  But 
I would not be surprised if that question were 
asked.  This question I deliberately omitted from 
our discussion, and Mr. Reuss did not raise the question.  But as
 your question recognizes by its very nature, this is a gray area.  However, certainly in the case of certain attachments pertaining 
to individual banks or their names, you see, 
well, that™s covered by the agreement.  Any 
attachment pertaining to relations
 with foreign central banks--now this may apply solely to the 
New York Bank--any such attachment would be omitted. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, I think perhap
s the reference is to such as executive committee minutes, audit committee minutes, established committees of the Reserve Bank board, 

as to which each keeps separate minutes. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there again, my
 own feeling is--I may be mistaken--that 
these need not be submitted. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  That woul
d be my recommendation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But I would not be too surprised if that question were raised by Mr. Reuss in due course. MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, is there a vulnerabili
ty to us if there™s great variance [across Reserve Banks], which I would assume there will be, in the style and depth in which minutes 

[are written]--we™re stars, at present, in having taken minutes ove
r the years that are absolutely 
meaningless.  Now, would he ridicule this a
nd say that Presidents of the Reserve Banks do 
nothing? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Probably.  Certainly possibly--I even think probably.  I would hope that, in due course, Mr. Reuss will become inte
rested in other questions
 of [unintelligible].  He™ll not pursue this [unintelligible]. 
MR. MACLAURY.  The treatment of the separa
te file on personnel matters and protection 
at the Banks--are those minutes to be he
ld here at the Board of Governors? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. O™Connell will talk about the technical aspect.  Well, let me 
say a word about that as I visualize the matter at
 this stage.  You have your minutes.  Now there 
are at least five categories, and you have technical procedures under which certain lines or paragraphs can be omitted.  That is, you have 
a Xerox, but certain parts are covered up.  Now 
just how that™s done, I don™t know, but we are engaged in this kind of business, unfortunately, too often.  Now then, the parts relating to these two categories, pe
rsonnel items and [Bank 
safety] items--those parts will be omitted in th
e first instance, you see, wiped out, but then 
included in a separate folder.  And that separate folder--the ar
rangement is that Mr. Reuss and 
I--this will not go to his staff--but Mr. Reuss a
nd I will go over that; what will happen at such a 
meeting or will result from such a meeting, I™m 
not able to predict.  
My guess is that, after 
looking it over, Mr. Reuss will show no further interest. 
SPEAKER(?).  Do the boards of directors [know of] this? 
11/16/76 - 16 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The Reserve Bank directors have been informed about this 
correspondence, and to what degree the Reserve Bank boards have considered it is something 
that our colleagues can advise us.  I don™t know, but let me indicate that my letter™s worded 
carefully.  It says:  ﬁIn accordance with our conversation last Friday, I shall advise the Reserve 
Bank boards to send you the minutes of their meetings
,ﬂ and this is what I™m doing.  I very much 
hope, in view of this, that the advice will be taken by the Bank board
s, but this is something that 
the Bank boards will have to take up themselv
es, and I personally feel that this is as good a resolution as we could have gotten.  I only hope that it stands. MR. KIMBREL.  Won™t you be having the ch
airmen and the deputy chairmen [of the 
Reserve Bank boards] here in a couple of weeks? 
 Would you feel at liberty to discuss this with 
them at that time? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh yes.  But I do think, having said what I™m saying in this letter, 
I shall do what I can to expedite the delivery.  I do think that if the Bank boards are going to do this, as I now hope they will, that this will 
get under way and that we™ll not delay unduly. 
MR. EASTBURN.  I™d like to mention, Mr. Chai
rman, some of us have board meetings 
this coming Thursday.  Did you say you intended to send this today? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I intend to send this toda
y, and copies will be made available to all 
of you, that is, the Bank Presidents, today, before you leave. MR. WALLICH.  I wonder if I could get the vi
ew of the Reserve Bank Presidents on this?  
Is this likely to lead to a change in the way 
the minutes are going to be written hereafter? MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, I would respond in th
is way, that I don™t think that this should be interpreted to our boards in any way other than a ridiculous request coming--I refer not to our 

Chairman--in other words, I think that the r
eaction of our directors will be one of great indignation and that I would do little to disabuse them of that feeling.  I would also think that if 
this involves a lot of work, which it will, needless work, that someone on Mr. Reuss™s 

committee, a friendly individual, should know wh
at we™re being called upon to do.  Because I 
think this can be used against Mr. Reuss if we react intelligently.  And, as I see it in the St. Louis case, it™s appalling how skimpy or 
meaningless our minutes are.  I™m
 sure we did this with great wisdom knowing that a man named Reuss would ask 
for them.  The minutes are really terribly 
shallow.  Tell nothing. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Mayo, please. 
MR. MAYO.  To what extent do you visualize coordination to be sure that we all read the agreement in the same way?  I can see a possibi
lity of one Bank including something, then Reuss 
coming back and saying, ﬁWell, where™s this from 
the other 11?ﬂ  And this sort of thing.  Should 
the Conference of Presidents [of the Reserve Banks] be involved directly in terms of, shall we 
say, monitoring this, or should O™Connell--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I was thinking of having Tom O™Connell do the monitoring, 
in the process achieving a substantial uniformity among the Banks.   
11/16/76 - 17 - 
    MR. MAYO.  We think it is ve
ry important that it be done. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes.  You see, these five categories that I mentioned are the five 
categories that turned up in the course of conversations of Mr. O™Connell with officers of the individual Banks.  Now, I™m not at all sure th
at these five categories are comprehensive enough.  But if they™re not, or if it appears that they
™re not, that will turn up in the course of Mr. O™Connell™s work with the officers of the Banks, and then, with your consent, I will try to 
resolve the matter.  And the way in which I think 
I would resolve the matter would be that if, let 
us say, there™s a sense that a sixth category [is needed]--you might handle that in the same way 
that the personnel items and the 
security items are be
ing handled.  However, that, of course, would become another subject for possible nego
tiation and possible confusion.  I™m very hopeful 
that Mr. Reuss will become very busy as the week
s and months roll on.  I certainly will be, but 
that will not stop Mr. Reuss.  He must be busy.  
If he can discover ways of keeping busy on other 
items--but I think he™s good over [uninte
lligible].  He has a staff that he-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  His staff-- 

MR. JACKSON.  Are references to actions [unintelligible] personnel issues of matters of 
substance? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™m going to leav
e that for Tom O™Connell to work out, you see, and that may become a sixth category put into
 a special file.  I would not want to treat any sixth category that may arise the 
same way that the first three cat
egories are being treated.  It™s because the last thing that I can ever do or
 will ever do is to go back on an explicit 
understanding.  But this is a possible gray area, and I think that my concept of a third file is 
perhaps as good a way as any of handling that if that problem arises. 
 Mr. O™Connell, would you like to comment now on technical issues. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, Mr. Chairman, with 
the permission of you, Mr. Chairman, and 
the Presidents, who are so closely involved in this.  Subject to the action of your Banks [in accordance with] the Chairman™s advice that woul
d be contained in the letter that would be 
transmitted, I would like, even as you™re returning to the Banks today, to be on the telephone in 
the conference call with the secretariats of your respective boards and the first vice presidents of your Banks, exclusive of John [Williams]--if it™s 
appropriate, I™ll get from you a designation, 
John, of an individual to whom I might speak at 
your Bank in this conference call.  The purpose of [my call]--after the Chairman™s letter is mailed 
to Mr. Reuss--[will be to read aloud] the letter 
and to give an outline indication of what I perceive to be the intention of the phraseology contained in the Chairman™s letter.   
And I intend, with your foreknowledge, to make
 a request to the people to whom I™ll be 
speaking that the minutes for the periods designate
d be transmitted in their whole form to me 
here at the Board [and that they be marked] us
ing a method that will capture the categories the 
Chairman will reference in his le
tter.  Namely that we bracket--and I™ll describe methods to the 
people to whom I™m talking--the categories one, 
two, and three that we are going to remove as sensitive.  That a different designation be pl
aced on those items in each of your minutes that 
don™t meet this first general removal category bu
t [that] in your judgment [meet] the second 
category [of] individual personnel matters and matters
 relating to security measures of the Banks, 
11/16/76 - 18 - 
    [which] will receive a separate designation.  And 
then thirdly, the group that the Chairman last 
addressed--namely, highly sensitive matters that 
don™t appear, in the judgment of your Banks, to 
fall in either of the two categories mentioned in the letter [but] 
which you feel, for stated reasons, should be kept out of the transmittal.   
By a separate marking of each [of these categor
ies], I™ll be able to see and coordinate the 
precise identical measurement of those withdraw
als and deletions.  Then I™ll return to your Banks a simulated copy that will be identical--hopefully, we™ve coordinated it, then, throughout the System.  And a separate method of placing in 
a separate file this third category [not yet covered in the agreement with Mr. Reuss].   
In total, what I intend to achieve, Mr. Chairman, is a uniform method of removal and 
deletion--a uniform method of clos
eting that which we will not disc
lose to Mr. Reuss pursuant to 
the Chairman™s letter and hopefully 
to do it as quickly and in a short a period of time as possible.  
Initially it will require, as has now been done in my conversation with respect to Reserve 
Banks--I™m of the impression that most of the 
minutes had been combed for all five years, 
through 1975.  I™m grateful that we can remove tw
o of these years from consideration and that 
our efforts then will bend toward the three years me
ntioned in the letter.  
I™ll undertake this effort 
of coordination by telephone conference today and then I™ll be in contact with your Banks as this process goes on. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I should add one detail, that is, in getting Mr. Reuss to cut back his request from five years to these 
three selected years, I do have an understanding with him, that I 
don™t refer to in this letter, but he does refer to in his letter, and that part of his letter is accurate.  Namely, that if he should find that these three y
ears do not satisfy his needs, he can come back 
and ask for those two additional years.  For that matter, he can come back if he wants to and ask 

for, well--when was the Federal Reserv
e established?--1913, ™14; who knows.   This is really an outrage, I think.  You know, it™s a fishing expedition pure and simple.  
Because if he really were inte
rested simply in assessing the influence that the Reserve Banks 
have on policy--monetary policy--then my offer 
to him was, I think, very generous.  Every 
communication with regard to the discount rate--not just, you know, the actual communication as it came and the telegram that you sent us or th
e letter--plus any petitions by individual Bank 
boards, plus any correspondence from individual directors.  I thought I was very generous.  But as I say, that did not satisfy his need as he expressed it, and the closest that [he] came to 
expressing his need was to say, well, he™d like to know what the Reserve Banks do, and he feels he™s entitled to it. MR. MAYO.  If he were to have any of his staff people contact any of us directly to get further information, what w
ould our posture be, Tom? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  It would be my reco
mmendation, once we™ve coordinated the 
undertaking, that, unless it was a question of information that
 you could readily give, namely, did 
you mail, what was included, and so forth, that y
ou refer the question back to me here at the 
Board.  I™m saying that only as a matter of c
oordinated policy because as it™s now proposed, 
subject to the affirmation of your Banks, we woul
d use this office and certainly the Chairman™s 
signature in transmitting this material to Mr. Reus
s.  Then I think it would be appropriate that 
11/16/76 - 19 - 
    any inquiry be directed to us.  I would say, Mr. Chairman, that, responding to a question earlier 
raised, I would intend to recommend exclusion from the transmittal of separately incorporated 

minutes, even though referred to at the initia
l transmission, that they™re not subject-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean separate vari
ous attachments, appendices, and the like? MR. O™CONNELL.  Correct, sir.  Yes. 

MR. COLDWELL.  What about audit committee minutes? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I would intend, Governor--my recommendation [would be] negative. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would sa
y at this stage that only 
full board meeting minutes be 
covered by this request.  At this stage, I think that™s a fair interpretation, but I would not be surprised if further requests were made, unle
ss Mr. Reuss becomes busy with other problems. 
MR. MAYO.  In other words, you would eliminate all executive committee meetings that 
act on the discount rate? MR. O™CONNELL.  That would be my--at th
is point, President Mayo, I would recommend that we exclude from transmittals anything but the 
main minutes of your board of directors, even 
though reference may be made to executive committee minutes, audit committee minutes. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me just pause for a minute.  Each Bank has a range of 
committees--as I think about the matter now, I am 
not sure that omission of executive committee 
minutes is really wise because, so often, disc
ount rate questions, you know, will be taken up.  
You see, there™s Mr. Roos™s problem that he mentioned, these minutes being so slender in his 
Bank.  And the chances are that that is true of a number of our Banks, pos
sibly all of them.  And 
since discount rate applications are, or discount rate decisions by a Bank board will, frequently be taken up at executive committee meetings, a
nd other vital business handled by executive committee--as I™m thinking out loud with you, in
 going back on earlier statements and in 
questioning Mr. O™Connell™s advice of this point--on second thought, I believe that probably executive committee minutes should be included. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  My reaction is the same yours, Mr. Chairman.  There™s 
no distinction basically between the executive co
mmittee meeting and our regular board meeting 
in the Bank.  If there are not enough directors there, we have 
an executive committee meeting, 
and I think we would leave irregular gaps that would just raise questions. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That would [not apply] to special other committees.  They are in a 
very different category. MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, may I urge
 then, that to the extent executive committee minutes would be incl
uded, that the same right a
nd function of withdrawal and exclusion from those be followed? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh yes, absolutely. 
11/16/76 - 20 - 
    MR. ROOS.  How do we protect ourselves from the reverse of giving meaningful 
information to him?  If he has too little inform
ation, he comes back and says one of two things, 
either we™re highly [unintelligible] in the case we do nothing, or we are so secretive in our activities that we don™t dare put down our nefarious 
activities.  I mean, it s
eems to me he™s got us 
either way if he wants to play that game, and I don™t know-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t know if there is any protection, and I would not be at all surprised if a by-product of this fishing expedition turned out to be a strong recommendation by Mr. Reuss, possibly by his entire committee, po
ssibly of a piece of legi
slation that he would 
introduce as to the character of minutes.  I w
ould not be surprised in the future--first, a 
condemnation, laying the basis, you see, for this reque
st as to the future.  Well, gentlemen, that™s 
the kind of world we live in, and I don™t think that this environment in which we function, that 
it™s going to change very quickly, nor am I ready to predict that it
™s going to improve this year.  
Any question, comment, criticism 
of this procedure?  I have
n™t sent this letter yet. 
MR. PARTEE.  I would consider it very fortunate if we can, get it off, and get it accepted-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  
Well, the important thing to protect here is the 
attachments to the minutes--in our case, they™re 
very long minutes and th
ey include a great many 
sensitive, as well as a great many dull, things. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you see if a question were raised about attachments, later on, 
then these understandings, if they hold--and I assure you that I™ll do everything in my power to 
achieve that objective that would apply to the att
achments.  In other words, if, let™s say, Reuss 
asks later on for the attachments, [then] these 
categories of exclusion and separate filings--these attachments would be handled in exactly the same
 way as the body of the minutes.  But let™s not 
anticipate too much.  There is still,
 I™ve said this three, four, fi
ve, times already, there™s still a 
possibility Mr. Reuss will 
acquire other interests in the course 
of the year.  One of the difficulties 
here, of course, is--you know, that™s part of the world we live 
in.  Mr. Reuss may well acquire 
other interests.  He has a very large staff.  I think they™ve put in long hours thinking up ways, you see, of harassing, etc. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The trouble is, he™s got a big enough staff so one of them could make this his personal interest. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh yes. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  Before closing, may I 
touch on a matter that Mr. Volcker has 
remarked, about the attachments again?  It™s quit
e possible that board of directors minutes will 
contain a reference to that board™s recent acti
on in recommending a discount rate for the Board 
and the Board™s response thereto, attached as Exhibit A.  Mr. Chairman, it™s quite possible that™s 
the very type of attachment you would want to e
xhibit to Mr. Reuss, consistent with the position you™ve taken all along with respect to the role that the Bank directors play in this action of monetary policy.  So that at the very outset, we may be includ
ing specific attachments as we 
review these minutes.  I didn™t want--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s think very carefully about that.  If you start including some attachments, but not others, then, to the ex
tent that Mr. Reuss™s staff is less imaginative 
11/16/76 - 21 - 
    than I hope they will be, you will 
ignite the imagination of one or another of his numerous 
troublemakers. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  In a way, you™ve done that
 when you™ve included the executive committee minutes, Mr. Chairman.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well executive committee m
eetings are different, as I think that Mr. Volcker explained that better than I did, that the [unintelligible] are an executive committee 
function for the board and at times, meeti
ngs of the executive committee are virtually 
indistinguishable from full board meetings.   
MR. O™CONNELL.  A
ll right, sir. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Anything else, gentlemen?  On this we™ve had two unsavory 
subjects for discussion, and if there is no further question or comment, let™s drink coffee and that would fortify us perhaps for-- [Coffee break] [End of executive session] 
[GAP IN TRANSCRIPT AT OPENING OF REGULAR MEETING] 
MR. MAYO.  [Unintelligible] is an even bigger question mark.  They have no familiarity 
with, nor have they paid as much attention, as usua
l, to the statements that have been made in the 
campaign or to the extent that they have, they wr
ite some of it off as campaign rhetoric.  They™re 
waiting for a philosophy to be expressed.  It doesn™t m
ean that they expect that to be against their interest, it™s just another element of uncertaint
y, and I think that™s [unintelligible] the stock market which again [unintelligible] has heightened the uncertainties. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Baughman please. MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I simply reiter
ate the references that have been made to the conservative outlook or feeling of caution that businessmen seem to be expressing at the 
present time, and this notwithstanding the fact that
 those that I have come in contact with are for 
the most part sitting in a rather
 vigorous economic setting.  I find 
a rather widespread expectation that there will be a move to more stimulation 
of the economy, and along with that, or shortly 
thereafter, a need for bringing into the picture some
 form of price-wage re
straint or control.   
And there is amongst the groups that I have cont
act with a widespread feeling that it is important that the anti-inflation posture be mainta
ined.  And I think flowing from that is this 
concern that this may not be maintained and is th
e reinforcement for this feeling of conservatism 
with respect to commitment on future economic 
activity.  And, of course, in the petroleum 
industry, there is so much concern as to what
 the government policy is going to be.  And so 
much of business there is 
related to the developments in petroleum.  So just more of a feeling of 
sitting and waiting than I have observed, I think, [than at] most any time that I can recall in any 
particular setting.   11/16/76 - 22 - 
    With respect to our economic forecast, it seems 
to me that there is 
reason for doubting the relationship between interest rate developments and th
e projected general economic 
developments.  And [that is] particularly [so] 
if we should not see the indications of some 
strengthening of inflationary forces.  With the amount of slack that
 there would still appear to be in the economy, [then] quite a few months in the future, if our projection of economic activity is 
realized, it seems a bit odd that ther
e should be associated with that higher levels of interest rates than prevail at the present time.   
So I would raise the question whether there is not a distinct possibility that, for some 
period of time yet, we may not see a continuation 
of what we™ve seen in the past month.  Some 
gradual rise in economic activity as
sociated with some gradual dec
line in interest rates--it seems 
to me that that would be a fortunate
 situation if it were to develop.  It seems to me, further, that it 
might be appropriate for us, as far as 
we can, to encourage this development. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Who would like to speak next?  Yes, 
Mr. Williams. 
MR. WILLIAMS.  As we see the same softness in
 retail sales, we have one unique feature in California; we have experienced a drought, at 
least until the last weekend or so.  We have 
[had] summer continuously through 
November, and this is resulting 
in [unsold] goods that would 
normally be sold as weather changes in the fall. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Would you just pull up the microphone please. 
MR. WILLIAMS.  We see the same softness that 
the others see in retail sales.  One unique 
feature in California has been the weather--w
e have been experiencing a drought.  We™ve had summer weather practically through the present tim
e except until the last 
weekend.  Several of the retail stores have mentioned [that] they ha
ve stocked goods for fall and winter that are not moving at all.  One other feature that one of our directors men
tioned, which is a very good short-term indicator--corrugated containers and envelope
 stocks have dropped rather precipitously in 
the last 35 days, and this is usually a good indicator of business conditions.  This has really changed in the last month. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now what about, are you referring to production or sales of corrugated paper? MR. WILLIAMS.  This would be the orders
 that they are receiving from buyers. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Orders they are receiving? 
 I see.  That™s a very good point there.  
Well--yes, Mr. Volcker. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  
One short preliminary question with respect to the 
wholesale price index in particul
ar.  My impression is that that
 has been decidedly affected by some fuel prices, including gas pr
ices, in the last couple of months, where there have been some 
administrative decisions.  Is that correct or incorrect? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s correct.  There were tw
o things that were big elements in the 
wholesale price index in October.  One was the 
rise of natural gas prices and other was the 11/16/76 - 23 - 
    inclusion in the index of the increased prices of new cars.  I have a figure, if I can find it quickly.  The increase in wholesale prices of industrial commodities, take out the energy items, in October 
was 7/10.  Whereas the total was 1.0.  A fairly large part of that increase was for energy items, 
and in particular, natural gas. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That was my impression, and that explains some of the 
seeming puzzle, I think.  But in general, my co
mments are very much parallel to those of Mr. 
Baughman, I think.  What I find in all the area
s that he has mentioned, Mr. Chairman, is 
substantial uncertainty.  It™s not so much that people are outright gloomy as that they feel 
substantially more uncertain about
 things than they did earlier, whether you are talking about retail sales or investment--where they were neve
r very optimistic, partic
ularly on our board of directors, anyway--and the price thing seems a little inexplicable to some of them under the 
circumstances.   
In terms of the outlook, I just want to empha
size the point that he really concluded on.  Some of this uncertainty--to some degree, I s
uppose, a more restrained
 outlook--is related to concern about inflation itself.  And the uncertainty is particularly emphasized by the coming to 
office of the new Administration that we don™t f
eel so sure about, and some concern that an 
increase in inflationary pressures will eventually
 [emerge] that will not be healthy for our own 
investment plans or for the economy in general. 
 So while the uncertainty is there, the policy implications of the uncertainty ar
e not all that clear in terms of 
that concern about relaxing on the inflation front. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Anyone else like to speak now?  Mr. 
MacLaury and then Mr. Roos. MR. MACLAURY.  I wish I had a better reason to feel that we may be overly pessimistic 
in our comments.  The one thing that J
ohn Williams mentioned was the drought in his 
areas--[our drought] has colored the sentiment in the upper Midwest pa
rticularly.  It has persisted and it is now really very severe.  It affects a couple of our states
 in particular, two or three.  Certainly retail sales, agricultural implement sales
--I think I said this last
 month--have been very 
seriously affected by the drought per se, which is not a national phenome
non.  That was coupled, of course, [with] the large harvests [which] ha
ve generally put their considerable squeeze on 
agriculture in our District.   Retail sales--I think you mentione
d, Mr. Chairman, [unintelligibl
e] and his figures, perhaps in the last two or three weeks, I 
guess three or four weeks, those have softened a little bit.  In other words, that steady uptick from two year
s ago that had impressed him has now faltered slightly.  I think that™s the only way to put it, faltered slightly.  It™s not a downturn by any means, 
but it™s not the persistent uptrend that he had mentioned to us a month ago.   
I say all of that, and that™s sort of on the downside, and yet I say my feeling is that, 
[although] this uncertainty is pervasive, it seems to me that it could go either way, and I guess I 
would disagree with Lyle™s feeling.  I would have a different feeling.  With the markdowns that 
have now taken place in the Board™s staff 
estimates of the outlook over the last two 
months--those markdowns are really
 quite substantial, $16 billion or so, I think, in final product at the end of ™77--I think it could as likely turn out that that 
now is on the too-bearish side; and 11/16/76 - 24 - 
    the foundation in terms of income, 
liquidity in the economy, is there.  And if we can get some 
confidence started one way or another, it seems to 
me that it™s very uncertain which way we go.  
I would not consider it more likely to
 be bearish than to be bullish. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Roos. MR. ROOS.  I would very briefly like to report, Mr. Chairman, that the head of one of the 
largest retail food market chains 
in our part of the country reported that, for the first time in 
several years, their industry is seeing a reemerge
nce in artificial increas
es in prices, which he attributed totally to an anticipation of the possible reimposition of price cont
rols, with all types of discount deals being offered as a means of keep
ing prices at their proper level but hedging against the possibility of controls.  And this was echoed in one or two of the other industrial reports at our recent board meeting.  I think 
it™s just interesting to put on the record. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Roos.  Mr. Partee now, please. MR. PARTEE.  Mr. Chairman, I don™t have any 
first-hand information, but just observing 
the data and reading the Redbook and looking at the staff projection and that kind of thing, I conclude that the economic setting [has been] 
weakening progressively over the last several months.  And it™s circular.  The difficulty is that the sales haven™t come in in a strong way.  In 
real terms over the last six months, retail sale
s are not up at all.  And as that has occurred, inventories, which should have seemed moderate
, have looked rather heavy, and output has been cut.  And as output has been cut, income has been lost.  The in
crease in nonfarm personal income 
from April to September in real terms has been 
at only a 2 percent annual rate.  So the income 
stream in fact does seem to be getting narrowe
r, weaker, and that troubles me very much.   
And I can™t help but wonder, when you have sales, production, and income all working in 
tandem to restrain the expansion in the economy 
and where that makes inventories look rather 
heavy rather than light, whether the next developmen
t won™t be a general backing away from 
capital spending plans.  We often around here said that, well, in an up year, what you generally find is that the surveys underestimate the incr
ease in capital spending.  We, I think, intended 
[unintelligible] to look that way, even if the risk is assuming that it was going to be an up year.  
It™s also true that in a down year the spending surveys can overestimate capital spending.   
I sense the possibility that we™re shifting in that direction, and in fact our next major 
disappointment may very well be what has been 
in the figures--some increase in capital spending 
is going to lose momentum.  I think that would 
be the next development that would convince me 
that in fact we may well have a smaller rate of re
al growth than the staff 
is projecting now.  I still can™t see the basis for an absolute decline.  I can™t see it in inventories, although I™m disturbed 
about--they raised the level of retail stocks by 3 percent? MR. GRAMLEY.  Right.  This is an annual revi
sion of the retail inventory numbers that 
takes into account principally the annual census survey of retailers, and the revisions went all the way back to ™74.  But the ™74 numbers were not ma
terially different.  They were affected mainly 
by some changes in seasonal adjustments, which th
ey do at the same time.  But beginning in ™75, 
the new estimates indicate the progressively larg
er level of inventories than earlier had been 
11/16/76 - 25 - 
    indicated in the data, such that by March, and still today, the level of inventories is about 3 percent higher than indicated in the earlier statistics. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  An interesting question.  You say progressively larger.  I don™t 
quite understand.  I understand that as an arithmetic thing, but what 
I want to get at is whether this is mathematics, or data, or experience.  I 
assume that this revisi
on is based on one or two new benchmark figures and that what happens in between is pure arithmetic. 
MR. PARTEE.  I think we need to reveal the stock-sales ratios. MR. GRAMLEY.  The stock-sales ratios 
have all been increased by that. 
MR. PARTEE.  Up to that point, I had not really thought there was really any chance of inventory shake-out.  And for that matter, I thought capital spending couldn™t go down very 
much--it hadn™t gone up very much.  It didn™t se
em likely that it could go down very much.  And I would expect that there could very well be a stronger fiscal policy than we have assumed in the 
staff projection, though I would note that that probably wouldn™t occur before early next year--maybe March or April or the fi
rst of May, but it is very distant-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Unless there is-- 

MR. PARTEE.  This catch up for-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This is still a cloudy--  MR. PARTEE.  Just to conclude, Mr. Chairman, 
I have to say that the figures to me have 
been very disappointing, almost unbelievable in 
terms of my prior per
ception of what would probably occur as we went through the fall.  And so I find myself quite concerned. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee.  Yes, Mr. Wallich. MR. WALLICH.  Well it™s most natural that one
 should search for signs of weakness at a time like this.  I note one that 
I think has not been commented on much.  Projections involved a 
slight reduction in the saving rate from the second to third quarter and then it stays [put] on out.  It goes from about 7 to 6-1/2 [percent] and stays there.  But as I look at the data, the main reason 
why this seems to happen is that, in the third qua
rter, personal income indeed did not rise very 
much, an assumption more or less carried on, and so
 that automatically cut the saving rate.  But 
now I ask myself, is there any good reason not to up it again after this quarter?  Was there any 
reason why it should have come down in the th
ird quarter, however slightly, and stayed down thereafter?  It™s about 1/2 per
centage point--that™s more than 
$6 billion--I think that™s not altogether small.   
The second point ties in with the discussion of the shortfall.  We have now more or less 
inadvertently slipped into a continuous full-employment surplus, with the exception of next 
quarter, where there is a minute defi
cit, but in general there is a 
small but not rising surplus.  I 
would have thought that this is rather early, for 
this stage of the cycle, to reach that condition, 
although I realize that at some poi
nt we ought to get there.  But 
given that we don™t have a very strong recovery, it makes me think a little about
 1958-59, when the budget also turned out to be 11/16/76 - 26 - 
    stronger, in the sense of less of a deficit than one anticipated, and I realized that we may be doing something similar again here.  I realize, of
 course, it™s a hypothetical computation on the 
benchmark full employment, something other 
than 4 percent, and you get a deficit.  Nevertheless, compared with what we thought ear
lier, the same benchmar
k, this is, I think, a significant change, unless it™s made 
up by a catch-up in the shortfall. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  May I ask you a question?  Has the sta
ff explored with the Budget 
Bureau people what they see in the figures 
they™re now compiling--what the level of federal 
expenditures for fiscal 1978 might be? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Not to my knowledge, Mr. Chai
rman, no.  We have certainly looked at 
the recent release of the current services budget figures, but I don™t think we have talked explicitly with them about probabilities for fiscal 1978. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, our current services budget, I have not really looked into this myself, but I have the impression that shows an increase of some 
8 percent.  Is that correct? MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s correct. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And as of today it seems 
unlikely that the new budget that will be presented by the incoming Administration will be 
lower than that.  A reasonable guess as of today will be that it would be higher, isn™t that true? MR. GRAMLEY.  I think that™s a real possibili
ty, yes, that the new Administration will be 
moving toward higher budget expenditures. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It may or 
may not, but that is certainly a real possibility.  Who™d 
like to speak now?  Yes, Mr. Gardner. 
MR. GARDNER.  I think it™s been well stated around this table that there™s a natural caution at the time of significant 
change in Administration.  Sitt
ing and waiting is a kind of 
exercise that brings on worry; it ha
rdly ever brings on optimism.  I am very interested in some of 
the comments that have been made.  Clearly our 
concerns as to whether 
or not we have a pause have been answered.  We do indeed have a pause, and we have considerable doubts in the minds 
of our Committee members.  It is entirely justified by events.   
But I also have to take some of the messages th
at I™ve heard appraise it.
  Bruce says things 
could go either way, and, Bruce, I absolutely agree with that.  Chuck has described some of the 
underlying economic basis that has le
d me for a month or so to conc
lude that it™s rather difficult to perceive higher unemployment, basically 
lower production, basically a sharp or even a significant drop.  We have ample liquidity in 
the economy, as you all know; we seem to have 
avoided, at least for the time being, mass hysteria a
bout the return of inflation.  Indeed, there are concerns, but basically the country is not convinced that they are going inevitably into inflation.  Capital investment which has been very modest to
 date in this recovery, understandably so, has an added value and the added value is the backlogging, or postponement, of things that business 
firms know they need to do, to a period wh
ere their vision is a little clearer.   11/16/76 - 27 - 
    Foreign investment is rising in this country. 
 I think this country 
is going to experience significant foreign investment 
considering the size of our economy.  The importance of our 
currency as the world™s trading currency and th
e figures occasionally encourage me it™s coming 
up quite significantly.   The point I guess I™m trying to make is that 
it™s my view that we are in a period of maximum concern about the policies of the new Ad
ministration.  And as the months ahead come 
by, I think we must remember that the Admini
stration coming into power has announced that 
they will balance the budget in four years, th
at they will attack unemployment, and as these 
events unfold and a mindless trivia of interi
m press conferences gets put aside for real 
pronouncements, I think you are more likely to 
find some points of confidence in these 
announcements rather than further concerns.  In 
substance, I™m willing to accept the clear fact 
that our signals are very unclear.  We are in 
a period of, not only pause--I wish I could coin another phrase, but I don™t read-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know, I™ll give you nice long phrase, which I hope you never use:  a ﬁmid-expansion retardationﬂ--what 
we used to call it at the National Bureau [of 
Economic Research]. 
MR. GARDNER.  The National Bureau calls it a mid-expansi
on retardation.  My basic concern is of more [significance than] what the ne
w President is going to say at tomorrow™s press [conference], and that is what the OPEC countries are going to do in December.  That is a condition of uncertainty, and that augments our fears and concerns.  But, you know we are going 
to shortly find out, and most [of what] has been suggested is unaccep
table to us, but at least it™s 
finite, and therefore Americans will get about th
eir business when they learn the outcome of 
those deliberations--perhaps in compact with the Administration 
policy--and try to do something 
about it.   So I™m not altogether pessimistic, gentleme
n, and I would expect the position we™re in today is very understandable.  I do think it™s a very understandable condition, but I do not take 
from it the inevitable conclusion that we are in
 a period of significant and important decline. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well I might add a word at
 this stage.  Any talk about a recession, I think, is absolutely premature.  With housing 
starts moving up rather sharply, with orders for 
nondefense capital goods in real terms rising at 
a moderately good clip, with the formation of 
new businesses moving steadily upward this year--I 
think talk about recession has very little 
foundation at the present time.   
Of course, there™s a very big pause in the expansion of the economy.  The question we™re 
discussing or that should concern us is where we™re going, and in my judgment, unless some 
very serious mistakes [in economic policy] and in
 the rhetoric of economic policy are made in 
the near future--and I don™t [think] they will be made, I think they™ll go the other way--I think the 

expansion will continue.  Now, a new report on h
ousing will be released sometime today.  That 
report will show that last month™s spectacular increase in hous
ing starts has been revised upward, and that there is some decline in the October figu
re--but that™s a small decline, whereas a rather 
large decline has been largely anticipated. 
11/16/76 - 28 - 
    MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, is that
 in single-family or multifamily? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The multifamily figure has been revised down for September.  I 
don™t really remember what the 
October figure is; the strength appears in one [that is, single] family.  Mr. Morris, please. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I share your feeling 
that it™s premature, to
 say the least, to be talking about recession.  I don™t think the numbers suggest that.  I think the issue is whether the rate of expansion of the economy is going to be anywhere n
ear what we consider to be optimal.  It seems to me that the projections th
e staff had given us are, I think, not unrealistic, and they are well below the rate any of us would describe as the optimum rate of expansion for 
the economy next year.  It seems to me this is
 the issue we ought to be concerned about in formulating the policy for the next period. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think you are entirely right.  It™s so difficult for us.  I don™t attach very much importance ordinarily to rhetoric, 
but if there ever was a time when good rhetoric 
would have an effect on business and consumer psychology and propel the economy upward, I 
think this is the time.  My own guess is that good 
rhetoric will be forthcoming.  It is a guess, and 
the good rhetoric will be accompanied, I think, in due
 course by rather constructive action.  That, 
too, is a guess.   So it™s so difficult.  You take our staff fo
recast--these poor fellows, they struggle to do 
what they can.  They know nothing about the budget, they know nothing about other policies.  They are very honest in keeping score on themselv
es, and on the basis of data now available, I think that our staff projection is a very respectable one.  One that certainly deserves respect.  I™m 
more optimistic than the staff, but the uncertainti
es are peculiarly great right now.  And if the outlook were no better than in our staff projection, the future would look very, very grim to me.  
Mr. Coldwell. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I™m not 
[unintelligible] pessi
mistic about our 
economy, and I agree with you that declaring a rece
ssion now is way too premature.  I am very 
concerned, however, about the state of confiden
ce, and I™m afraid we may get a couple of 
additional shocks.  One which I keep saying--and I haven™t found anybody that agrees with me 
yet, but I will continue to say--is that I am wandering around this 
country and believe that we are getting Christmas sales very early 
this year.  We may get a severe shock in terms of the rate of 
sales when Christmas gets here. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™re more pessi
mistic about sales than Mr. Lilly. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Perhaps so, but I keep wand
ering around, going into stores to see if I can buy Christmas presents for myself, and I find 
Christmas sales going on at a pretty good clip, 
and yet I don™t see a major movement in the sale
s.  And if we are really borrowing from the Christmas sales level, we may fi
nd ourselves greatly disappointed. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But, you know, our statistics on retail sales are scandalously poor.  Exaggeration, Lyle? MR. GRAMLEY.  No, not at all.
  The only thing [worse] that I know are the inventories. 11/16/76 - 29 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Look what you get.  You get weekly figures, and then you get--what do you call it--the advance, and then you get something called preliminary, then 
something called, very much in quotation marks,
 final, and they keep on jumping around.  You 
don™t quite know where you are, and by this time
 our government ought to have vastly better 
statistics on retail sales.  Would you agree with that, Chuck? MR. PARTEE.  Yes, and I would remind you th
at the program was beefed up a few years ago.  Quite a lot of money was spent on it--four or
 five years [ago] or so, I don™t remember quite 
when that occurred.  It is a very hard thing to measure, with new stores opening--  
MR. COLDWELL.  Well, for whatever reason, I s
till think we have a problem with that.  I 
think the uncertainty that I feel in talking to people around the country not only relates to this but also to no real incentive to expand purchasing.  On the capital spending side, in talking to businessmen, I find they are still quite hesitant 
about it and [have] no real push behind it and they are still looking at an interest rate level which 
they consider to be quite high for commitments in 
the long run.   On the employment side of it, I also feel [tha
t] is an area of potent
ial shock.  Just a very random piece of information--even some of the 
banking openings are not very plentiful right 
now.  I™m talking about the lower level, not [abou
t] the people sitting around this table.  I find some people out in the streets, which surprises me
 a little bit in the banking field.  And I wonder if, not only this, but the potential of our foreign banking problems, might constitute some 
difficulty for us in the next few months.  All in 
all, this is a kind of psychological problem I think 
we face and one which needs some [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think the hour has come for somebody to speak of, not shocks, 
but of pleasant surprises.  Can someone affect
 the gloom Mr. Coldwell has passed over us, over 
this meeting, at least over my own life in the past minute?  Mr. Wallich, he has volunteered for 

the purpose; make it good, now. 
MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, this isn™t going 
to relieve your gloom, I fear, but that of 
some people--which seems to be the increasing probability of a tax cut of some kind.  More and 
more, the newspapers are full of not only political but economists™ statements pointing in that 
direction, and I think one has to begin making one™s 
forecast, to begin to think what kind of a tax 
cut this might be.  I would very much hope that it
 would be something that
 is at least in part oriented toward investment, not all oriented to
ward consumption.  I hope 
it would be something 
short-lived.  I think it 
would have some negative confiden
ce elements, but on balance I would 
think it would be expansionary if it isn™t made permanent.  If 
it™s made permanent, I think the 
confidence element would become more serious.  
Well, this cannot be in our projections here, obviously, but I do suggest that it™s not an unrealistic expectation. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  In that connection, have you ever given a lot of thought to that, and--well, maybe I live in a strange world, or my thoughts dwell in isolation, possibly--when I hear of proposals concerning a tax rebate, I just scratch my head.  What does it mean?  It means 
that our government, which is heavily in de
bt, will now go out and borrow more--$10 billion, 
$15 billion, figures like that are being thrown 
around--and then a check will be written to each 
one of a certain category we™ve talked about, poor, or poorer, people, and how do you build?  
11/16/76 - 30 - 
    And if this is the best that we
 can think of as a way of building the strength of our economy, then 
I™m going to join the gloomy fellows, and I™ll be
come gloomier than Phil Coldwell, really.   
If you want to build the economic strength of 
our country, there are ways of doing it.  Now one of the very best ways of doing it, one that I think recognizes the need to avoid social conflict, one that also recognizes the limitations of our economic knowledge
, is the technique that was used by President Kennedy and by the Congress.  Kennedy proposed in 1962 some refinements 
that became law in 1964, but what
 kind of tax reduction was it? 
 It was a tax reduction that applied across the board for individuals and that applied to corporations as well as to
 individuals, and therefore a tax reduction that met two basic criteria--there are others, but it met two:  
minimization of social conflict and, second, re
cognition that, well, we don™t quite know [what 
would be best]--we have [only] theories, we have ideas, [about what] is the most advantageous 
way of stimulating--and therefore, you see, the bets were bei
ng hedged with this across-the-board tax reduction, individuals and 
corporations.  I thought that wa
s a stroke of political genius 
at the time, and there was a tax cut that proved-
-I think ﬁprovedﬂ may 
be too strong a word--in my judgment, it worked extremely well.   
A rebate, it™s like an aspirin pill to my mind [
unintelligible], just a little bit, and what you want through a tax bill, if this is conceived of as a measure to stimulate the economy, you want 
to change peoples™ minds about themselves and 
about the future.  And how you can do that with a rebate, I don™t know--even if the rebate applied to everyone, you see, rather than being concentrated at one end of the income scale.
  But maybe I have a 19th century mind and don™t 
understand the world we live in.  But I do think, really, that better counsel
 will prevail, and I™m 
quite optimistic about that.  Mr. Winn. 
MR. WINN.  I™d just like to pick up Steve Gar
dner™s point, which I certainly share.  I think this uncertainty is going to disappear in a way that
 will be constructive before the trees come into 
blossom in Washington in the spring.  And again, 
we have our old cliché, perhaps maybe we are 
worried too much about it at this point--we have nothing to fear but fear itself.  And, indeed, when we discover a little more about the philo
sophy of a new government, we will find that 
business confidence will have a resurgence that 
will make our present projections look very 
conservative. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Anyone else like to speak?  Mr. Guffey, please. 
MR. GUFFEY.  You were looking for optimism, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, no I wasn™t.  I was a moment ago; now perhaps it™s time to 
become a little more pessimistic. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Well, I™d like to report that, in
 the Tenth District, retail sales are holding 
up quite well, and as a matter of fact, looki
ng toward the Christmas season, retailers are 
anticipating a very good season.  But to also, I guess, endorse what President Mayo and Governor Gardner just said, it seems to me--a
nd you will excuse me for not relying upon figures, 
because I am not a trained economist--it should
n™t be surprising that businessmen and even 
consumers are in a period of uncertainty.  And it 
seems to me fairly cert
ain, also, that, without regard to what the final outcome when the new 
Administration [unintelli
gible], it may be that 
11/16/76 - 31 - 
    businessmen are going to accommodate those, and 
this inactivity is going to burst out.  And 
whether the timing is by the blooming season in Wa
shington, I don™t know.  But I think it™s fairly quickly into the year 1977. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You know, if I may join Mr. Coldwell in the interest of balance, I 
feel as he does about an increase in the price of oil at the present time.  The world has not yet 
adjusted, not by a long shot, to the quadrupling in the price of oil that occurred toward the end of 1973 and the subsequent increase in 1975.  I feel very strongly about that and had some quiet--I don™t know how quiet--something to 
say about that in the recent testimony as one of the major 
uncertainties facing our country [and], for that ma
tter, the world economy, at the present time.  
And if that can be prevented--I think it can be
 prevented--I think all of
 us will have very good 
cause to feel much more cheerful about the ec
onomy.  And on the other hand, if it goes into effect, then I think that the words of gloom that
 have been heard around this table might well be 
intensified.   
Anyone else like to speak before we break for luncheon?  Very well,
 we™ll do that now, and we™ll be back, let™s say--what is your preference, 2:15?  It™s
 1:15 now, 2:15 or 2:30?  Let™s 
have a show of hands for 2:30.  A show of hands for 2:15.  2:15 is agreeable. 
[Lunch recess] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we should 
be resuming our deliberation, and let us 
give the floor now to Mr. Sternlight. MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Statement-- see Appendix.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Sternlight, any new questions? MR. EASTBURN.  Peter, what would be the ma
rket reaction to a 1/4 
percentage point cut in the discount rate? MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think it would be fairly moderate.  There™s been talk of a 
possibility of a discount rate cut.  It was a little more active a few weeks ago.  It is dampened 
down in the last couple of weeks as the market 
perceived stronger aggregates.  But I think it would be a fairly moderate react
ion at this point, even so. 
MR. PARTEE.  A 1/2 point would come as a great surprise. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think a 1/2 point would be rather a surprise, and that would generate a sizable reaction, yes. MR. BLACK.  What would be the nature of the reaction? 

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, I think it depend
s on what accompaniment of open market 
operations there were at the same time.  If we 
were still around the 5 percent funds rate, I think the 1/4 percentage point--unless the market perceived that we
™re going to be edging down from 5 
percent funds--that would be a rather mild reaction, with bill ra
tes not moving any more [than], 
perhaps not as much as, that 1/4 percentage poin
t, and lesser rate moves in the longer end of the 
11/16/76 - 32 - 
    [curve].  If there were any accompanying lower fe
deral funds rate atmosphere, depending on just 
how much lower and over and what time path, whet
her it could be a little more reaction on the discount rate-- MR. BLACK.  Suppose you did lower the federal funds rate and simply announce the 
discount rate changes as a realignment of the 
discount rate to minimi
ze the [unintelligible] effects. MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well I think it could be a fairly moderate reaction, and perhaps if the 
funds rate were down 1/8 to 1/4 below the 5 percent, and the discount rate came down 1/4 
percentage point with accompa
nying announcements of technical realignment, then the market 
rate might be at the short end in the same
 order of 1/4 percentage point, perhaps. MR. BLACK.  What I was really getting at, I 
guess, was Chairman Burns™s remark earlier 
today about the good rhetoric. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, any other questions for Mr. Sternlight?  Well, thank you 
Mr. Sternlight.  We will now hear from
 Mr. Axilrod, who also will be brief. 
MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Axilrod, any questions?  Well, you™ve been so 
lucid, Mr. Axilrod, there™s no need for questioning.  We™re ready to turn 
now to our monetary policy discussions.  We hope that, as we go ar
ound the table, members of the Committee would 
address themselves, among other things, to the 
question whether our economy is now short of 
liquidity and what economic gain, if any, members of the Committee would or might expect 

from some easing in credit conditions.  I hope also
 that the Bank Presidents would express their 
view on the desirability of a reduction in the discount rate.   I would like to say just a few words, not about the discount rate but about what I think is the basic question:  Is our economy short of liq
uidity?  I don™t see it really.  The banks are hungry for customers, and savings banks, particul
arly savings and loan associations, have enormous inflows of funds.  I doubt, really, if 
the easing of the monetary conditions would have 
any significant influence on the behavior of the economy at the present time.  However, I do 
think that, in view of the economic information th
at has come our way and that we expressed at 
this table, some easing is presently indicated.  Bu
t I also think that the easing should be slight.  And I say that for several reasons.   First of all, the very high rate of growth of the monetary aggregates in October has been noticed, and while it appears that the November figures will sh
ow moderation, the exceptionally 
high numbers in October are still in the minds of
 many people who watch statistics on the money 
supply.  [Also] I think that the easing, if any, should be slight in view of the very large increases in price indexes that have recently been pub
lished--though the interpreta
tion of these indexes leaves something to be desired.  [And] I think 
the easing should be slight in view of the possibility that the discount rate may be adju
sted downward.  Finally, I feel that the easing should be only slight because there is a widespread view around the country among 
businesspeople, financial people, that the Federal Reserve more than ever is the main bulwark 
11/16/76 - 33 - 
    against inflation and that the basic monetary policy received by the Federal Reserve has served 
our country well and should be continued.   Now as for specific numbers, to give you somethi
ng to shoot at, I lean toward alternative B with some modifications--some slight modificati
ons:  M1 range as designated; M2 shaded down slightly to 9 to 13; and the federal funds rate at 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, the midpoint being 4-7/8--the 
intention being to move down to
 the midpoint this week unles
s the figures that appear on Thursday show extraordinary growth in monetary aggregates, wh
ich seems rather unlikely from 
the preliminary indications that we have.   
Now as I say, these are suggestions for the 
Committee to shoot at, to oppose one way or 
another or possibly to endorse.  Who might speak 
first?  Mr. Kimbrel, Mr. Guffey, Mr. Morris, 
Mr. Black, Mr. Mayo, Mr. MacLaury, Mr. Wallic
h, Mr. Partee, Mr. Winn, Mr. Coldwell, Mr. 
Jackson, Mr. Williams, Mr. Baughman, Mr. Volcker, 
Mr. Gardner.  [Mr.] Volcker will definitely be last.  Mr. Gardner will speak whenever he wants to.  Mr. Kimbrel please. MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, I think [there 
is] not much more to be added because I™m 
prepared to accept almost literall
y just what you concluded.  I thi
nk there is adequate liquidity, I 
see no indication of any lack of liquidity in the system, so I do not foresee the need for easing for 
that reason.  I remain considerably concerne
d, as do our directors, about inflationary expectations.  I would also hope that consideration of the discount rate could be favorable, maybe of 1/4 point, and I say that mainly because
 of the announcement effect that might have 
with the market.  Obviously, it is
n™t being used a great deal, but I think it might have some 
favorable influence from the announcement.   
As for the numbers you assigned to alternative B,
 I am prepared to acce
pt all of them.  I guess I feel very strongly, though, that if we could, I would hope we could operate almost [always] in the range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent.  During this period, I would be reluctant to see the 
rate come below [4]-3/4 and I most assuredly 
would not like to see the rate going up.  I am 
prepared to accept the numbers you assigned there.
  I would hope actually it would be somewhat 
more constrained. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much, Mr. Kimbrel.  Mr. Guffey. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Well, I would share that f
eeling [about] moving to 4-7/8 and fairly 
quickly--what we tried to do a month ago and were not
 successful.  It seems 
to me that the case 
is as good now as it was then.  The only question about the number
s that you propose, Mr. Chairman, with respect to M2--if
 we™re going to give equal weight to the two of them [M1 and 
M2] as we have in the past, I would just as soon adopt the numbers [for M2] in alternative B, which are 9-1/2 to 13-1/2, in view of the staff™s projections.   With respect to liquidity, everything that we 
see would indicate that liquidity is very good and that most of the financing that™s going on in
 the business community is out of cash flows, which indicates that liquidity is there.  With 
respect to easing credit, I wouldn™t think it would have a great deal of effect at the moment to go only to 4-7/8, a
nd it seems to me that the public 
needs sort of a stroke or boost, which this might 
provide.  And with respect to the discount rate, it would be that additional kick, coupling the two together.  It seems it does very little damage in 
11/16/76 - 34 - 
    terms of the aggregate growth rates as projected by
 the Board™s staff, and I think it may be vitally 
important. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. Morris, may we hear from you? 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, with respect to
 the three points you asked us to comment 
on--this issue of shortage of liquidity, I think you really have to say, ﬁcompared to what?ﬂ  I 
think, certainly, the economy is more liquid than 
it was a year ago, but if you ask about the state of liquidity relative to where it has been in
 corresponding periods of the business cycle, earlier business expansions, I think you would find that the answer to the question is that the economy is 
less liquid than it has been in corresponding periods of expansion.  Certainly this is true of the corporate sector, [which] is nowhere near as liquid as it was in the earlier economic expansions. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Of course, you™ve had a secular trend there that complicates 
interpretations. 
MR. MORRIS.  Yes, I know that it has a secular trend, but I think, nonetheless, if you would ask the question, is the corporate sector more or less liquid than it was in corresponding 
states of business expansions, you would have to say-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All that I mean to say 
is, that™s a very fair question, but you have to interpret it, I think, in the light of the secula
r trend.  Now, whether your statement will still be 
correct, I don™t know.  You™re probably right; I™m just not sure. MR. MORRIS.  The other dimension of it is that
 if you think of liquidity in terms of the 
availability of money, I think quite
 clearly money is available, but here again, money is available 
at substantially higher interest rates than was the case in corresponding phases of business expansion.  I think it™s particularly important for the housing market
.  That is, mortgage money is 
available, but it™s available at rates consider
ably higher than we have encountered in other periods when housing was expanding. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You say that about the real rate of interest? MR. MORRIS.  Well, no but I don™t 
think the real rate of interest is particularly important 
to the individual buying a home.  I 
don™t think he thinks in terms 
of real interest.  I think he thinks in terms of the amount of 
the monthly payment relative to hi
s salary.  And I think that the increase in interest rates we have seen over the past five years has required, say, the young adult buying a home for the first time-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I not only agree with that, but I™m making a speech on Thursday, 
and I™ll make a great deal of this very point. 
MR. MORRIS.  He has to pay a higher percentage of his income than we did when we 
bought our homes.  Would it make a difference if we 
moved to a different policy?  I think yes.  I 
think it would certainly be helpful to the securities markets; I think it would be moderately 
helpful to the stock market as well as the bond mark
et.  And to the extent that it would promote a 
trend toward lower mortgage rates, 
I think that would be helpful.   
11/16/76 - 35 - 
    On the discount rate, I think we ought to move.  I™ve been restraining my board from 
moving, but I think that the time has come.  I 
think in moving, though, I would recommend that 
we move a 1/2 rather than a 1/4.  That is, if 
we move a 1/2, that would only bring the discount rate down to where the federal f
unds rate is at present.   I am pleased that you propose that we do move
 to a somewhat more expansionary policy, 
but I think I would move a littl
e further than you suggest, Mr. Chairman.  I would propose a 
4-1/2 to 5 range on the funds rate, instructing the Manager to move to 4-3/4.  This is a marginal 
difference, but I think the evidence is persuasive enough to me that we need to move more than 
1/8.  And therefore I™d like the specifications of alternative A better.  It seem
s to me, for us to be 
publishing specifications showing a range [with a lower bound] as little as 2-1/2 percent on M1 in this context bothers me a bit.  I™d rather see the range on M1 be 4 to 8.   And it seems to me in this context that we ought
 to give more weight
, at least temporarily, 
to M1.  Because I think it™s pretty clear to me 
that if you have to ask yourself which series, M1 or M2, is more descriptive of what appears to 
be going on in the real economy, I think that you™d 
have to argue that M1 should be given, in this context, more weight than we normally would 
give it.  That™s all I have to say. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Black now, please. MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, when the aggregat
es spurted in October, I think it was quite wise to resist overreacting by pushing up the federal funds rate.  Now that we see the aggregates are likely to come in less rapidly than they ha
ve been, I was hoping that you would show similar 
precaution, not overreacting to the do
wndrift in M1.  Regardless of 
what happened to M1, I think 
your time and savings deposits are go
ing to continue to grow pretty fast.  Thrift institution 
deposits are going to grow, with the interest rate relationship [bei
ng] what it is, and I think this means that there™s going to be a continuous am
ount of liquidity added to the economy, and I 
believe that the liquidity level is 
very adequate [unintelligible].   
I feel that the economy is a litt
le stronger than the staff thinks, but I must confess that I 
have growing doubts about my position on that, wher
eas I think that liquidity is adequate.  I 
think Governor Coldwell made a very important poi
nt:  Most businessmen think interest rates are 
too high in order to commit on plant and equipment 
[unintelligible].  So I™d like to see us move 
gradually downward a little bit.  I emphasize that word ﬁgradu
al.ﬂ  I ordinarily favor an aggregate directive; at this time,
 I am leaning toward a money mark
et directive.  And I would set a ceiling of 5 percent on that.  I just don™t think we should dare move above 5 percent; the risk™s 
on the other side.  I would put 4-3/4 on that and go down to 4-7/8, like you suggested.   Having done that, I think the stage would then be set for perhaps a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the discount rate.  I think this is a 
good chance for some of us to use some of that 
rhetoric you talked about.  If the [Federal Reserve] Board thinks it wise, I™d hope you would consider what you might do on reserve requirements, 
expressing that this is not really a change in policy but a structural change, the same way we would change th
e discount rate to bring it in line.  Because I think part of the lack of conf
idence we must not [forget] stems from fears of 
inflation.  If they think we™ve thrown in the towel [with] this little easing now, actually it could be counterproductive. 11/16/76 - 36 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Mayo next, please. MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I™m prepared to ac
cept a repetition of our range at this time 
on federal funds for a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  I feel strongly about the 5-1/4.  I do not want to see a 5-1/2; I think it gives the wrong impression all the way al
ong.  I could be talked into a 4-1/4 on the low range as against a 4-1/2, but I think my preference is the 4-1/2.  It gives a feeling of stability, and yet, the midpoint being 4-7/8, I think this is some
thing that we can gradually work toward.  It would give a little feeling of ease to go along with what I agree, too, should be perhaps a 1/4 point change in the discount rate.  I wouldn™t go as far as Frank.  I, too, have resisted movement 
within my board to lower the discount rate.  
It™s been quite a vocal and articulate response, 
interestingly enough, by the bank members [of my 
board], not by the nonbank members.  I don™t 
know how you would explain that 
to the chairman of the Hous
e Banking Committee.  But I find 
that this is the way the sentiment runs. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s the nice thing about our country.  We don™t all think alike.  
Everyone does his own thinking in his own way. MR. MAYO.  I have already indicated to our board of directors that my recommendation is 
still firmly in favor of keepi
ng the discount rate where it is, but I™m not guaranteeing that there 
would be no change in that recommendation as we look to the next full board meeting, which 
would be a week from tomorrow.   
On the M1 and M2, however, I guess I split a little here.  I thi
nk I prefer the 3 to 7 [for M1] and the 10 to 14 [for M2] as the points to watch on our ranges for November-December.  I share 
some of Frank™s problem with the 2-1/2 [l
ower bound for M1growth] looking awful [skimpy], 
and I haven™t that much confidence in the figur
es.  I™d rather just round them, and I™d round up 
rather than down in both cases. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. MacLaury now. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I 
find myself in virtually total agreement 
with the specifications you gave and the reasoning for those specifications.  On the discount rate, I would certainly favor, at this point, a 1/4 point reduction.  I realize that there are a number of interpretations that one could give to a discount rate re
duction.  But I would see it as a modest stimulus to confidence, and it se
ems to me that™s [what] we ar
e talking about at the moment, 
trying to find ways in which we can bolster confid
ence [so] that the future will be less bleak than 
the staff projections or others are predicting.   And in that context, I guess, given Mr. Gardner™s comment about my wishy-washiness on 
my earlier intervention, I ought to say that I share Bob Black™s feeling, and yours, I guess, Mr. Chairman, that the staff projections
 are too low.  That doesn™t m
ean that I™m far above them, but 
it indeed says that if I were at a 5-1/2 percent kind of real GNP rate for ™77, then you™d still argue that that™s too low given the circumstances.  So it does not trouble me
 at all to see us indulge in a mild easing at the moment, and that™s I guess how I™d interpret your specifications. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Wallich now. 
11/16/76 - 37 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  As I look at the liquidity, Mr
. Chairman, first, I share Frank Morris™s 
feelings that, in technical term
s, using the usual measurements
 of liquidity applying to the working capital, liquid assets, debt/equity and so forth, we are not in a very liquid condition.  We™ve made some improvement, but it™s small improvement compared to long-term 

deterioration.  Liquidity at the present time exis
ts in the sense of plenty of funds around--could very well be the result of slack business rather than
 a cause of better business.  That is always a possibility.  So the fact that there are seemingly idle funds around does not suggest to me 
necessarily that these funds are going to go to work.   As for the gains from easing, I think that th
ey™re probably not likely to be that great.  There™s even a danger at this time.  To start easing la
te in an expansion--after all, it™s a year and a 
half, now, into this--could get us to the point where, if this to
ok and really were effective, it could cause us to hit the capacity 
ceiling a year or two from now 
with too much speed.  We made 
that mistake before.   
Well, saying all this, I come 
out for a slight easing.  I™m 
not too much concerned by the 
longer-term interest consequences
 of something like alternative 
A--that we would have to raise rates substantially later on.  Aside from the fact that we can change the one-year target, I think 
base drift alone, if it occurs, would take care of this and not necessarily drive us into higher interest rates.  So I would recommend a 3 to 7 
on M1; 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 on M2; and 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 on the funds rate, bearing in mind th
at I think we are slipping into a dangerous habit if we narrow the funds rate.  We™ve put ourselves into a box, and I™d
 like to keep us at least at a 1 percentage point [range for the funds rate] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Partee please. 

MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree to 
a very considerable extent with Governor Wallich.  I don™t know whether there™s enough liquidity
 or not, and the statistics seem to show 
considerable improvement, but the economy is not 
performing well.  And so, in terms of defining 
what we want in the economy, w
hy, I think we could use some more
 liquidity.  The idea used to be expressed as ﬁyou can™t push on a string,ﬂ but I don™t think we are in that soggy a situation.  And I think that liquidity would improve borrowing 
and lending attitudes.  One positive effect of 
some increase in liquidity would be the downward pr
essure on short-term interest rates.  Lower 
short-term interest rates, it seems to me, would 
present institutional managers, particularly the 
banks and thrifts, with the portfolio problem of deciding whether 
to continue to put their funds disproportionately into very liquid assets at a possibly negative carry or whether to push more 
aggressively to make longer-term loans and investments.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This is where they have been now for a while, but you mean it 
would intensify them? 
MR. PARTEE.  This would intensify them.  Thei
r third alternative is to reduce the inflows 
of funds by cutting rates off on savings.  Some, I 
think, would go in every direction.  But at least 
some institutions would move more aggressi
vely and try to make long-term loans and 
investments and thereby communicate some easing 
in the long-term markets, some downward 
pressure in the long-term rates.   11/16/76 - 38 - 
    Now, as far as the aggregates are concerned, I™m not terribly concerned about that October number on M1 because I do think now that we have
 to look at September and October combined.  
And if we look at that combined, if we look at the year to date, the expansion rates don™t seem 
excessive to me.  But in any event, if we c
hoose an aggregates directive, which I think we definitely want to do, we protect ourselves agai
nst the possibility that the aggregates will go up 
quite strongly in November and December.  Beca
use if they do, we™ll move the funds rate, we™ll 
be up at the top end of the range--and maybe above the top end of 
the range, and perhaps it will be a reason for an additional instruction to the Manager if the aggregates do grow strongly.   Now, I™m more inclined to th
ink that the aggregates are go
ing to grow quite weakly in November and December because of the state of the economy.  But then, that could be wrong 

too.  If they do, however, grow weakly, then having the aggregates target would mean that we 
would be moving down in the funds rate and perhaps again have a special meeting.  So I think 
it™s an important time to have the directive stated
 in terms of the aggregates simply because of 
our total state of ignorance of what is going to be shown in the aggregates performance in this 
and the next couple of months.   Well, I would support alternative A, but I would support it with the variations that Governor Wallich suggested.  That is, I think we could cut the M2 growth rate a little bit, and  then--I think you said we™d cut it a 1/2 percentage point on each end, didn™t you, Henry? MR. WALLICH.  That™s right
, up to 3 to 7 percent. MR. PARTEE.  I™m speaking of M2. 

MR. WALLICH.  Oh, M2, 9-1/2 to 13-1/2. 

MR. PARTEE.  I think I would buy that, and I think I would also buy the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 funds rate range, which means that the midpoint 
is 4-3/4, and it would presume a move to 4-3/4 
unless the aggregates were performing quite unusually, quite abnor
mally high or low.  We would 
move, say within a week or so, to 4-3/4, so that would be my view.  And I won™t say anything 
about the discount rate. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee.  Mr. Gardner now. MR. GARDNER.  Well, in hopes that I can conform to what I said earl
ier, I would support some easing, as you™ve suggested, Mr. Chairm
an--modest, responsible easing--because I™m 
convinced that developments will unfold in this 
period and give us further indications of what 
the real underlying situation is.  I feel a little like somebody 
with a surgeon™s scalpel attempting 
to treat a patient with hives--mysteries of th
e formulae compounded by the staff are still new to 
me.  Nevertheless, I don™t want 
to overlook the fact that, while November aggregates may indeed 
bring the October burst into better perspective, we did, in fact, ha
ve a very substantial growth in 
October--very substantial, much more than I™ve
 seen since I™ve been 
on this [Committee].   
Well, the aggregates, even with a modest N
ovember, appear to be growing satisfactorily 
for this stage of the economic cy
cle that we find ourselves in.  And in short, I would support a modest easing.  Governor Partee picked alternative A and modified it, when I thought, really, 
Governor Wallich modified B.  I therefore end up
 a little more comfortable with 3 to 7, 9-1/2 to 
11/16/76 - 39 -     13-1/2, and I don™t want to go down to 4 percent on the funds rate.  I thin
k that™s prejudging far too early.  [Unintelligible] so I would stay with the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4. [GAP IN TRANSCRIPT] MR. WINN.  I found the Greenbook this time terr
ibly depressing reading.  It seems to me 
that we have to show some concern in that 
area, whether you accept 
it or not.  I would be interested to know whether we have run the projections on the basis of the high end and the low end of the aggregates to see what difference it ma
de in the outcome, in contrast with the median 
figure we used for our monetary estimate, because
 I feel flying blind is [not] knowing what the implications would be. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I found out, but the question as to blindness or good vision still remain open.  Mr. Gramley, since-- 
MR. GRAMLEY.  We make our es
timates taking the aggregate growth of the midpoint at 
the longer-term range.  I have presented, on variou
s occasions, estimates of the impact of moving 
from one end of the range to the other.  We di
d not do that at the time of the last long-term 
projection meeting because my feeling is that, gi
ven the uncertainties about what™s happening to 
velocity and what™s likely to happen to it in the future, and given the effects that traditionally are 
associated with 1 percentage point more or
 less money growth, that we™re not giving the Committee information that™s particularly valuab
le.  That is, the uncertainties are sufficiently 
large that these tiny differences in GNP growth
 that we get adding 1 percentage point more 
money growth, 1 percentage point less, are insignificant. 
MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, [unintelligible] I 
think my feeling would be to associate 
myself with alternative A modified
 to the funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 as an indication of concern over the current outlook.  The second is, by changing the rate, hopefully we™ll change some of 
what I consider some of the sticky market rates 
and get the effect both in the short-term area and in the long-term area, which I think 
would be conducive at this time.   
I think my preference would be to take adva
ntage of an easing s
ituation to move the 
reserve requirements because I think we™re going 
to be faced more and more with [Federal Reserve System] membership problems as [banks
] look at their earnings.  On the other hand, a change in the discount rate would have a psychological [unintelligible].  Rather than 
complicating the Desk management problems in a se
ries of changes, I would be in favor of the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 [for the federal funds rate] and a move down [in] the discount rate. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Winn.  Mr. Coldwell please. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I™ve been accused of being a harbinger of gloom today 
already, a couple of times, but I really think th
at our economic prospect
s have dimmed over the 
last couple of months.  And whether we accept 
the staff projection or not, the unemployment 
levels predicted in those projections are unacceptable, gentlemen. 
 I think the only question that I face here is a question of stimulus.  Do we stimul
ate this economy in fiscal or monetary [ways] 
or both?  I have a great reservati
on about leaving all stimulus to the 
fiscal side of life.  If we™re going to hold monetary policy and leave it to Co
ngress to stimulate this economy, I think we™ll 
11/16/76 - 40 - 
    come out much worse than if we attempt to do 
some ourselves.  I think 
the policy can provide a little bit of help in easing rates.   
As a consequence, that™s where I come out.  I 
would prefer to see the federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5, and I would stop at 5, because I think we are at 5, and I would prefer that we not go down to the midpoint of that ra
nge--that it be asymmetrical, as we™ve done before--go down to 4-3/4 and then look and see.  But I would not prefer to have an
 upper [limit] over the 5 unless we reconsidered the matter.  On the monetary growth
 rates, there™s been a suggestion of 3 to 7 [for M1]; I would hope that we would not go down as low as 3.  I would prefer to put a bottom of 4 
on it, but I suspect I™m going to be in the minority 
here.  But nevertheless, I would prefer a 4 to 8 range.  As far as the other matters of policy 
on discount and reserve requirements, I will not 
comment at the moment. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell.  Mr. Jackson please. MR. JACKSON.  I share Governor Coldwell™s feeling about the economy and particularly 
the unemployment rate.  At the same time, while
 [the unemployment rate] may be unacceptable, 
I think the real question is, what are you going to do about it, if [there is] anything you can do about it?  To that extent, it™s 
my conclusion that there™s a rela
tively limited amount that monetary 
policy can do about it.  There may be only slightly
 different action that fiscal policy can take, and I™m inclined to believe that there are limits as to
 what fiscal policy can do about it.  To that extent, I think that our action in this country in that particular area lies in fields as yet untried, in the area of structural changes to which we™ve been addressing ourselves in various speeches and so forth.  And until the country does address itself to some of thes
e structural changes, we will 
continue to be frustrated in our conclusions.  And the consequences may be counterproductive 
rather than effective.   
Nonetheless, having said that, I do feel that in the general environment in which our 
country is operating today, that some ease in nominal rates of inte
rest are appropriate.  I really wonder whether lower interest rates necessarily
 will produce the more expansive growth in 
monetary aggregates, particularly over the short run, that we™re discussing today.  At the same 
time, I™m inclined to think that if we only ease 
1/8, it will not be sufficiently [evident] to the general public to accomplish the goals that we™re r
eally trying to [accomplish].  It™s my judgment 
that, to a significant degree, these are cosmetic
 rather than substantia
l, and properly so--only cosmetic.   
To that extent, I would be more inclined to ha
ve a federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5, or 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  I™d be inclined toward 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 with an asymmetr
ical 4-3/4 [midpoint] rate, but I 
think these are mechanics.  The main thing is, I™d 
like to see us go to 4-3/4.  [For M1 and M2], I would be inclined to use [alternative A]--3 to 7 fo
r M1 and 10 to 14 for M2.  It appears that the staff™s projections--and we™re a quarter of the way into the two-month projections--lead us to 
believe that we™ll have about a 12 percent rate of growth in M2, anyway, and it strikes me that 
the portion of the market where M2 rates of gr
owth are so sensitive are the places where we do 
continue to need an assurance of liquidity, if I can put it that way--the housing market being one 
of them.   
11/16/76 - 41 - 
    I share Governor Partee™s feeling that we
 may be getting close to the place where 
managers, particularly in the thrift institutions
 and savings departments of commercial banks, 
may be having a reassessment of what they can 
continue to pay and at what rates they may 
reinvest their funds in order to stay in business.  It strikes me that if 
we view the housing market 
as being one of the basic strengths, a significant reduction in interest rates on long-term home 
mortgages, and by that I mean 1/
4 or a 1/2 point, as a result of 
continued liquidity that thrift industries [unintelligible], would be a method of
 sustaining that demand.  I don™t think it would 
help the multifamily side of that market at all. 
 I think it takes something substantially more than 
that, and, in fact, the inflationa
ry trend in construction probably will outrun even any change in 
interest rates that are likely to take place,
 so I don™t see much change in that.   
But it strikes me that, if we™re hanging ont
o two things right now as being signs of strength, namely housing and hopefully final cons
umer demand, these two areas strike me as 
being a good place where we might have some genui
ne impact from a monetary policy point of 
view.  And to that extent I would be inclined to [put] M2 [at] the 10 to 14 range. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Williams now, please. 
MR. WILLIAMS.  We would favor a 1/2 percen
tage point reduction in the discount rate.  This could probably be done in two steps of 1/4 each.  We think this would give a better 
alignment with the federal funds 
rate, and it would also give a lift to business expectations.  We 
would also support a slight easing of policy.  We think that
 this can be done under the established or the existing ranges rather than changing the ranges.  We would favor alternative B, 
although we could support alternative B as modified by Chairman Burns. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Williams.  Mr. Baughman please. 

MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I can fi
nd quite acceptable your suggestions on 
modified alternative B.  I™m a little uncomforta
ble with a 2-1/2 on the bottom side of M1.  And 
so far as the fed funds rate is concerned, I guess I™d be a little more inclined toward 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 than the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  W
ith respect to the directive, I would endorse Governor Partee™s very appropriate arguments in favor 
of an aggregates directive.  It
 seems to me that that applies 
to most circumstances, but I™d agree that it appl
ies particularly well at the present time.   
I would agree also with those who indicated that they would welcome seeing some change 
in reserve requirements.  With re
spect to the discount rate, I would argue as strongly as I can that we make a change of 1/2 [point
] at the present time.  I think 
1/2 is justified for a number of reasons.  I think it™s superior to 1/4 on the grounds that a change of 1/4 now probably would need to be followed by another change of 1/4 before
 very long, and I think two such changes coming 
in sequence would tend to carry more of a s
uggestion to the public that the economy was 
continuing to weaken.  For five weeks now, the av
erage of the three-month bill, the three-month 
CD, and the three- to six-month finance paper rates have been more than 50 points above the discount rate. MR. PARTEE.  Below. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Below the discount rate.  A
nd it seems to me that the rationale for 
changing the discount rate should be aligning it with the market.  And it seems to me that that 
11/16/76 - 42 - 
    rationale cannot be used unequivocally if the change is only 1/4 point at the present time.  
Another observation I would toss i
n, I would qualify it before doing it as possibly not being very significant.  We™ve had 19 banks make arrange
ments for seasonal borrowings this year.  
Fourteen of them have borrowed, but as the di
fferential between the market rates and discount 
rate has widened, the numbers dropped off.  We
 have three [banks] borrowing at the present time.  Now, of course, that™s 
not the only reason, and probably not even the preponderant reason, for the change in the number of these little country banks that have been borrowing, although information available to us from surveys indicates 
that there is a pretty strong demand for credit 
out in the country down there.  So, as I say, I would argue as vigorously as I can that we move 
the [discount] rate 1/2 point.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Mr. Lilly now, please. 
MR. LILLY.  Well, there™s been
 a lot of conversation here, and some of the remarks 
[indicate] that businessmen think the rate structur
e is too high.  I agree with that, and the reason that I do is that, in the short-term rates, it™s part of the cost of the product, and it™s too high.  It™s related to cost of sales, and if it came down, it certainly would ha
ve some impact on pricing the 
product.  The long-term rate is re
lated to capital investment.  The 
lower that long-term rate is, the more likelihood there is of a surge of capital investment.  So, 
on that kind of a basis, I would like to see the funds rate at 4-3/4.  How you get there, I don™t know.  I kind of liked Phil Coldwell™s 4-1/4 to 5, and I concur in Henry™s and Chuck™s M1 and M2 numbers. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Lilly.  Now, Mr. Volcker has, well, he™s preempted the last place. 
MR. ROOS.  Second from last. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Third from last. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Volcker has preempted 
the last place, and therefore that place 
is reserved for him.  And the question is, who 
else would like to speak now?  Mr. Eastburn and 
then Mr. Roos and then anyone else who wants to speak again, because Mr. Volcker definitely speaks last.  Mr. Eastburn. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Well, Governor Partee has e
xpressed my views.  I think the economy 
needs some stimulation and that monetary policy ought
 to play a role in that.  I find it difficult to accept the idea that there isn™t [anything] that mo
netary policy can do.  We don™t have a liquidity 
trap operating in the economy at the present time, 
and I think some modest 
easing is in order.  I would prefer alternative A as far as the aggregates are concerned, and I would prefer a funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 administered on the asymmetr
ical downside.  And I would like to see the discount rate cut [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Roos, please. MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, if one of our purpos
es is to throw out signals and to affect sentiment, I think it™s terribly im
portant that we do not adopt a posture of very recognizable ease.  
Regardless of what we do, I think the primary 
attention of the economic community will be on 
what the incoming Administrati
on is going to do.  I think the confidence of the business 11/16/76 - 43 - 
    community basically will depend on the determination--should the incoming Administration 
move toward ease--[of] the willingness or a demonstration of the fact that the Federal Reserve is 
going to stick by its guns.  For us to feel that there would be a constructive reaction to a recognizable easing by this [Committ
ee], I think, is misjudging the ball
 game.  I think that if we 
were to signal something that amounts to signifi
cant ease, it would destroy confidence and would be a deterrent to positive activity on the part of the business community.   Structurally, I think that alte
rnative A is less than acceptable if we believe in our long-
range targets, because if we do accelerate the grow
th of M1 over the next two quarters, and if 
we™re going to stick within our target range, it™s going to mean a substantial deceleration of M1 
growth in the second and third quarters of next year.  And a corresponding rise in the fed funds rate--if we take this action today, if we do go the [alternative A] route, I thi
nk we could at least say to ourselves that we will be prepared to bite the bullet in the middle of next year to correct 

this course.  I wonder whether we™re really prepared to do that. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Roos.  Does anyone want to speak before Mr. Volcker?  You won™t [have] anot
her chance after Mr. Volcker.  A promise is a promise.  I made 
Mr. Volcker a promise.  There are a few things th
at I could ever do for Mr. Volcker or, for that matter, for anyone else.  It™s within my power now
 to make him the last speaker.  I™ve given him 
that promise.  I must deliver on it. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™d
 rather trade being the last speaker for some other 
things you gave me. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Partee. 

MR. PARTEE.  Well, I just want to say, in resp
onse to President Roos™s last comment, that 
I think he™s referring to the fact that alternative A, given the long-term ranges that we have 
adopted, implies a firming later next year.  And I w
ould just want to point out that that presumes 
that the staff projection of nomi
nal GNP growth is correct.  If, in fact, the staff projection of nominal GNP growth was too high and it came in
 lower, you wouldn™t have as much money 
growth and there wouldn™t necessarily need to be a tightening--so, that sort of a construct in the 
way the Bluebook is put together.  If that staff 
projection comes out right, and if we should hold 
[for] four quarters to the ranges that we adopted in the telephone meeting, then you would need 
to tighten some, later on in the peri
od.  But only under those conditions. MR. JACKSON.  Conversely, if they 
are low, we™d tighten earlier. MR. PARTEE.  Yeah, sure. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  For the sake of symmetry
 only, if the staff projection is too low--  MR. PARTEE.  Then we would be faced with the issue sooner. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Sooner and on a larger scale; and/or on a larger scale. MR. WALLICH.  Provided there™s no base drift. 
11/16/76 - 44 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we
 are ready for Mr. Volcker. 
SPEAKER(?).  Do you wish to stand up? 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So I could pronounce the benediction, maybe I should.  
The advantage of coming last, of 
course, is that everyt
hing you agree with has already been said, but a few things you may not agree with have been said too, so you™re still forced to say 

something.   
One way or another, we™ve all been talking about how we can sustain a more satisfactory pace of economic expansion next year.  And I w
ould just say, as a preliminary to the comment 
on monetary policy, that [as] I 
look at the situation, and following some of the analysis that 
Governors Partee and Wallich had earlier, the 
case becomes stronger for some fiscal action in 
terms of weaknesses and personal income and declin
es in savings rates and feedback effects we may be getting on the rest of the economy.  I do 
[think] that case is growing [stronger], and I suspect we may get some [fiscal action].  I hope
 it™s not of a rebate type, for the reasons you suggested, Mr. Chairman.  I once testified that
 I thought it was a bad precedent when it was done 
by a Republican Administration befo
re--this idea that you just give away the money without any 
relation [to] a tax burden itself.  It doesn™t seem to me to be very helpful.   
But in that context, we have the question of monetary policy at the moment and how these 
two fit together.  And partly for the reasons that Mr. Roos has just described and that you described earlier, I think, it should be a measured move and 
not a feeling that we are now embarking on a rather aggressive course of ease.
  And I quantify that, in my mind, anyway, that 
through open market operations, I wouldn™t want 
to see the federal funds rate pushed down by something like 1/2 percentage point, prospect
ively, over this next month, based upon what I 
know now.  I don™t particularly want to see it pushed down 1/4 percentage point right away.  On the other side of it, I share the view of those who don™t want to see it go above 5 percent, either.  I think that would give entirely the wrong signal at the moment.   
On the particular questions that you asked about liquidity, I don™t think there is any certain answer.  Frank Morris has spoken my piece about that
.  I think, really, it™s all relative to what 
you want.  The kind of action that I would talk about isn™t going to produce any very substantial change in liquidity anyway.  But I think what we are looking for is a little encouragement for 
long-term financing and a little encouragement pe
rhaps to [get] some of the longer-term rates 
down a bit to help the investment and housing side
 of the economy.  And that point has already 
been made.   
I end up on the open market side of the thin
g--right about where you began all this, Mr. Chairman, with the focus on the federal funds rate
--contrary, I guess, to what some other people 
have said.  What I don™t quite understand is why we emphasize the ag
gregates at this particular time, a point I want to pick up in a second.  It seem
s to me this is a time when we are particularly 
sensitive to what the federal funds rate is doing, and I came in with the kind of spread that you 
suggested, of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  I don™t really want to use the upper quarter of that, but I would move to 4-7/8, and pretty promptly here, based 
upon what we know now.  I really don™t want to go down to 4-1/2 either, as I suggested earlier.  So I™m symmetrical in th
e sense of not wanting to use either side of the range, but get a little easing pretty promptly.   
11/16/76 - 45 - 
    So far as the aggregates ranges are concerned, I should point out I don™t attach any great weight to any of these estimates, but the 
New York Bank estimates for some reason are 
substantially lower this time than the Board estima
tes, which are already, at least in M1, fairly low.  Partly that seems to be for reasons--they 
don™t believe the seasonal, and they think we may 
be entering a period where, without reflecting any basic weakness, we may be running into some 
fairly low M1 figures and M2 figures relative to what we™ve b
een having--and really significantly lower than the Board™s projection.  Well, I don™t know what importance to attribute 
to that, except it lends a little weight to Mr. Partee™s feeling.  They may come in on the low side 
rather than the high side.  It is a reason why, consistent with my feelings about interest rates, I™d like the [alternative] B specification; and I thought the M2 one was a little high, as you did, Mr. Chairman, relative to our longer-term objectives. 
 I was prepared to suggest even a percentage point lower there.  You suggested a 1/2 percentage point lower.  I™m perfectly content with that.  
I do get a bit frightened as to the public reaction in terms of our general posture if we begin 
publishing 10 to 14 percent figures after the rate of growth that we have had there.   One of the objects of the strategy we ought to have now--and this is where the discount rate comes in--is to, in a sense, 
[jawbone] institutions.  I™m not su
re they™re right on the edge--as much on the edge as I would like to see them--but
 I think there is some 
possibility of getting a reduction in the administered depos
it rates here.  And a discount rate change could help in that connection by putting our own feelings in the matter a little bit more out in the open.  I think the 
time has come for a change in the discount rate.  
I even find the arguments rather persuasive for 
going 1/2 on technical and other grounds, if, in fact, the open market policy was as moderate as I 
am suggesting.  If we gave a much louder signal 
to open market operations, as some people have 
suggested, I guess I would want to mute the signal on the discount rate.  And I think the other combination might be a little more helpful
--not really go overboard on the open market 
operations but bring the discount rate more into line with where the fe
deral funds rate is in fact.   It seems to me a more logical combinati
on of moves, but I still find myself with a 
somewhat open mind about whether th
at should be 1/4 or 1/2.  But in any case, the effort here, 
and I think the major contribution we can make, 
is providing a little incentive to get some of 
these interest rates down without really drastically changing our policy and without arousing fears that we are going overboard with increasing the liquidity of the economy against the prospect of a possible tax decrease shortly following.  I think there is some real danger of 
overdoing it, in fact, and maybe more so psychol
ogically in terms of the balance of concern 
about inflation and expansion.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, thank you, Mr. Volcker.  I think we™ve had a very interesting discussion.  The main conclusion I™v
e developed from this di
scussion is that the differences that have been expressed within and by members of this Committee are 
preponderantly very small indeed, 
so there is a substantial degree of unanimity on the part of the 
Committee.  And all that we have to do now is 
refine these numbers slig
htly, recognizing that very little sanctity attaches
 to any of these numbers.   
Now, the thinking of the Committee, as I read it
, is as follows with regard to our numerical 
specifications.  There is a slight preference for 
a range of 3 to 7 for M1, over against 2-1/2 to 6-1/2; there™s more dispersion w
ith regard to M2--very few would want to go above 13-1/2, and some want to go below 13-1/2.  I therefore, on bala
nce, think 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 is perhaps fairly 11/16/76 - 46 - 
    representative [for M2].  With regard to the fede
ral funds rate, there is a margin in favor of the 
4-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent range as over against 4-1/4 to 5-1/4.   Now that™s my reading of the views that have been expressed by the Committee.  If any members of the Committee have changed their minds
 because of what they™ve heard from their 
colleagues, you might advise me of 
that at this time.  In the ab
sence of that, I think we should 
vote on the following specification:  the 3 to 7 per
cent for M1; 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 for M2; and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 for the federal funds rate. MR. PARTEE.  That last rate, the midpoint would be 4-7/8,
 is it, rather than being skewed? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that
 is--we could discuss that-- MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, what would you 
read as the consensus on where we would move the federal funds rate, say, in the next week--4-7/8? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I would say yes, that is to say, the only thing to hold it up would be--well we don™t want to move immediat
ely after the meeting.  Now, on Thursday our 
figures will be in, and unless the figures are outside the range very high, I think the Desk 
definitely would want to move toward 4-7/8 on Fr
iday.  Whether they actually get there or not, I 
think that™s something we ought to leave to th
e Desk.  If you don™t get there on Friday, you ought get there next Monday. MR. PARTEE.  I have expressed the preference for 4-1/4 to 5-1/4.  I would be prepared to buy 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, but if so, I™d like to have it understood that the midpoint is 4-3/4.  That is, that 
we move in a timely way down to 4-3/4 and then 
look for further reductions from that point.  So 
in that sense, I would shift it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let™s have
 a show of hands on that. 
SPEAKER(?).  That™s a 4-3/4 midpoint. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we™ll call it a midpoint.  We put quotation marks around it 
and we will have a show of hands on 4-3/4 versus 4-7/8.  That is the midpoint--they™re in 
quotation marks.  Those who prefer 4-3/4 will kindly raise their hands. MR. BROIDA.  Seven. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s the way we™ll 
do it.  That is to say, we still have to vote on it.  Let me repeat what we will be voting on. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Mr. Chairman, could I as
k on that whether, in going for a 4-3/4 
target within this range, we contemplate the similar timing-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, you would want to do it more gradually. 
11/16/76 - 47 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  4-7/8 Friday, maybe, and then
 4-3/4 midweek of next week--something 
like that. 
[LAUGHTER] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that isn™t very gra
dual.  I think the way to do it gradually is to do [the first] one within a week, and the other within two weeks.  So if you do it by Friday, let™s say by the following week-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  My question about this whole thing, Mr. Chairman, 
would be, obviously there™s very little difference in these ranges, whether you move them up or 
down 1/2 percentage point on paper.  But I am looki
ng at at least one set of projections that says we™re going to come straight in under the low 
point anyway, as it is.  Now, I don™t know what the reliability of these project
ions are, but what happens-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, you do.  You know it™s low.  The hour is late Paul. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Do you go to 4-1/2, is what I™m asking, under those 
conditions?  Fairly 
readily, that™s a-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We have to live by rules or we have a communication, an interchange, by telegram or otherwise, between meetings.  If you™re saying that you would be 
uncomfortable going down to 4-1/2, so would I.  But I would think this is--the rule now, we could now choose another limit, and--well, there 
are circumstances you know
, with regard to the economy that might clearly make it 
undesirable to go as low as 4-1/2 so promptly, if the figures 
do come in low.  That™s the rule we operate under,
 and this is not the time 
to change the rule.   Should I specify what we™ll be voting on?  All 
right, M1, 3 to 7 percent range; M2, 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 percent; and the federal funds rate, 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, with the understanding that 4-3/4 will be interpreted as the midpoint in quotation marks. 
MR. PARTEE.  And which directive? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, we sti
ll have to decide that, and let™s have a show of hands.  Those who would prefer a monetary aggregat
es directive will kindly raise their hands. MR. BROIDA.  Six. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Those who would prefer a money market directive? 
MR. BROIDA.  Five. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I will join the monetary aggregates group.  Now, and the 
language, well, the language, yes.  The staff has 
given us no choice of language in the monetary 
aggregates directive.  Well, I think we™re
 ready to vote.  Any further comment? 
MR. JACKSON.  I gather we™ll have the revised version of our testimony on the new 
[monetary aggregate ranges]; that the Committee will discuss it? 
11/16/76 - 48 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, no, we really ought not to.  We™re not ready for that. 
MR. PARTEE.  This would say moderate monetary growth. 

MR. JACKSON.  This is the old-style version, Chuck. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Still, we™re not going to change any rules this meeting.  However, 
I assure you, we™ll change it at the next meeting, a
nd I™ll have a word to say about that presently.  Would you be good enough to call the roll. MR. BROIDA. 
Chairman Burns           Yes 

Vice Chairman Volcker    Yes 

President Black     Yes 

Governor Coldwell    Yes 

Governor Gardner    Yes 

President Guffey    Yes 

Governor Jackson    Yes 

President Kimbrel    Yes 

Governor Lilly    Yes 

Governor Partee    Yes 

Governor Wallich    Yes 

President Winn    Yes 
Unanimous. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, now, item 7 on
 the agenda, we will not take up today.  
The date of the next meeting is Tuesday, but I 
think we need a little more time, and I would 
suggest that we make personal plans for a la
te afternoon meeting on the Monday preceding the 
Tuesday meeting.  Then we™ll take up item 
7 and a few other matters--a foreign currency 
directive--and there™s much more we™ll be ready 
for at that time.  Thank you very much for the 
meeting, gentlemen.  Have a good week.
