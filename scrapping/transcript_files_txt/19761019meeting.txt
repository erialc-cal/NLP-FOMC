October 19, 1976 [Executive session] 
 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me call, at the ou
tset, on Mr. O™Connell for the brief report [unintelligible].  Is Mr. O™Connell here?  
MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, sir.  I™ll briefly 
report, Mr. Chairman, on the two pieces of 
litigation that are pending in our federal courts.  [The first is] the Merrill versus the FOMC 
[case], which the Committee will recall involves the suit, [based] 
on the Freedom of Information 
Act, calling for--and I™ll use general terms--imm
ediate public access to the Committee™s Record 
of Policy Actions, its policy statements, and 
interpretations.  The 
court™s order required publication immediately in the Federal Register of policy actions and the immediate availability to the plaintiff of the Memoranda of Discussion of January and February 1975.   Now, as the committee has been informed, certain aspects of this order were appealed 
immediately, particularly as it related to th
e [Record of] Policy Acti
ons availability upon adoption.  With respect to the Memorandum of 
Discussion, you will recall that, pursuant to the 
court™s order, the Committee gave to the plaintiff reasonably segregable facts.  We extracted 
those facts from the two Memoranda requested [and]
 furnished them to the plaintiff.  Further 
pursuant to the court™s order we furnished to the court the complete Memorandum of Discussion, 
in which we had interlined the material given to
 the plaintiff and the ma
terials withheld, telling the court that there were certain facts that we have
 not given to the plaintiff but that we felt could not be reasonably segregated and given to the plaintiff without destroying what we believed to be the defensible withholding of certain policy determinations and discussions which under the law 
we felt were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.   
[After] that document [was] submitted to the court, we heard no more until, on October 5, 
Judge Waddy issued an order saying, upon his revi
ew of the Memoranda as submitted to him, he 
determined that the entire Memorandum of each
 date, January and February, should be made 
available in its respective entirety 
to the plaintiff, and he said that such shoul
d be effected within 10 days of his order.  That order was signed and dated on the 5th of October.  We learned of that 
order on the evening of the 14th of October, the night before our appeal time would expire and 
before the effective da
te of the order.   I™ll just comment briefly that the postmark on 
the envelope containing that order showed 
marks of a mailing in Washington on the 6th of 
October; a mailing from 
Frederick, Maryland, on the 7th of October; someplace in Gaithersburg on th
e 8th; and then delivery to the Department of 
Justice on the 12th, with notice to us on the 14th.   Because of the time sequence, and the fact th
at our time had expired, and my inability to 
contact the Committee, I directed 
that a notice of appeal be file
d that evening in the Court of Appeals and that an emergency motion for stay of 
the effectiveness of the lower court™s order be filed with Judge Waddy.  A letter to that effect 
was transmitted to the Department [of Justice].  
10/19/76 - 2 - 
The notice of appeal was filed on Friday, and we have pending before Judge Waddy a stay of his 
order.  At this time, that is the status of this matter.   
I will go to the Court of Appeals today or tomo
rrow to try to work out a Court of Appeals 
stay of the effectiveness, and I 
will advise the Committee of the first action we have with respect 
to that stay.  At this time, I believe it™s in st
atus quo.  The notice of appeal has been filed, and it will then go to the Court of Appeals.  There is no 
further word with respect to the portion of the 
court™s order we appealed.    We had oral argument three weeks ago on this
 matter.  The court was a good court.  A 
three-judge Court of Appeals court.  I think they had read the pleadings.  We had a very responsive panel.  A good chief judge of the panel, Judge Leventhal, asked some very 
penetrating questions of both c
ounsel, I thought.  And the court 
ordered the matter submitted for 
decision.  We have filed one supplemental memo
randum with the court as
 requested, and that matter now is before the court for decision.   
A few words on the Reuss suit, designated Reu
ss v. Balles et al.,  against the Presidents.  
The last information I gave you was a matter of 
pleading into position, namely, that we had filed 
various pleadings, the latest of
 which I think you had knowledge.  We had filed an opposition to 
certain of the plaintiff™s pleadings.  You recall 
that we filed a motion to dismiss this suit on 
jurisdictional grounds, particularly the lack of standing of Mr. Reuss to bring the suit.  In response, Mr. Reuss, through his counsel, filed a rather lengthy reply to our motion to dismiss.  
He filed opposition to everything we had filed an
d further filed a motion to interplead as a 
defendant the Federal Open Market Committee as a body.   
So there is now pending a motion to interplead the Federal Open Market Committee as a 
body--the [members who are] Presidents, [who] were
 in the original suit, [plus] the Board [of Governors] members--[the court has] now been
 asked [that the Governors] be joined as defendants.  And this, the pleadings [make] clear, is for the plaintiff™s intent that the court have 
jurisdiction over the Committee to enjoin any decision involving the Presidents should that be attempted.  It™s a ploy on his part.  We have f
iled an opposition.  And we have filed appropriate responsive pleadings, including a reply to the plaintiff™s pleadings.   As of Friday he has filed a further motion 
for oral arguments on all pleadings and asked 
that argument be had particularly on his motion 
to join the FOMC [to the suit as a body].  I 
advised the Committee at the last 
meeting that we were going to seek a protective order against a 
request for admissions--the plainti
ff had filed a very lengthy request for admissions.  We did file 
for a protective order, and some
 two and a half weeks ago, the District Court granted our motion 
for protective order and ruled that we did not have to reply to these requests for admissions.  At 
this point, that™s about where that matter stands.  
It™s a matter of pleadings, 
and we are due to file more responsive pleadings this Friday.  Mr. Chairman, I belie
ve that is a summary of both 
matters.   
[End of executive session] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much.  
Any questions?  Very well, we now need 
to act on the minutes.  And Mr. Broida has s
ubmitted a memorandum to the Committee, dated 
10/19/76 - 3 - 
October 13, indicating that it woul
d probably be desirable to inv
ite the Committee to approve the 
minutes with the understanding that a paragr
aph would be added regarding the recent arrangement with the Swiss Nationa
l Bank to pay off our debts.   Now is there a motion to approve the minutes s
ubject to that understanding?  That is to 
say, the understanding that a paragraph be added of the technical details 
worked out by our staff with the Swiss National Bank [that] are [to be] approved by me by October 
22?  I™ve looked into 
the matter some, and I want to make a final careful check [unintelligible] with almost certainty 

be able to do that before [unintelligible].  
Any questions about this action?  [Will] anyone be 
bold enough [unintelligible].  The motion has been duly made.  Anyone bold enough to second?  
It has been duly seconded.  And any objections?  
Let us turn to the report from Mr. Pardee on, 
well, before that report, perhaps a word or two would be appropriate on the Manila meetin
g and certain additional travel that I just 
concluded.  The one outstanding event in Manila was the meeting of the [unintelligible] 
committee which, as you know, consists of represen
tatives of industrial countries, representatives 
of developing nations in, well, equal numbers.  Every finance mini
ster [who] was at that meeting 
expressed the view, unequivocally, [that] the number one problem facing the economic world is 
the problem of inflation.  I have 
[said] strong policy measures to d
eal with inflation are essential, and that the unemployment problem will not be solv
ed unless inflation is brought under control.  
Now this was to me an event of [unintelligible] 
and such unanimity or even a rough approach to 
it would not have been possible five years ago or two years ago or even one year ago.  Apparently finance ministers around the world, wh
ich means financial people generally, have 
arrived at this conclusion.  The summit meeting 
undoubtedly [unintelligible] the significant part 
of helping to shape financial opinion.  [At] that
 meeting, as you may reca
ll, the several heads of state indicated that the objective 
that they intend to work toward 
is the complete [eradication] of 
inflation, not merely a reduction of [unintelligible
], but achievement of ge
neral price stability.  Now I think that was the main event at Manila
, but perhaps Mr. Volcker and Mr. Wallich would 
like to make some additional comments.  Mr. Volcker.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I think there was a fair degree of harmony 
displayed.  That™s the only thing that surpri
sed me, in a way, even among the LDCs [less 
developed countries] in terms of not pushing 
for unrealistic assistance programs.  I was 
impressed by the degree to which they didn™t 
seem to object to the relatively hard line 
[conveyed] from the United States to other countrie
s.  These are the financial representatives of the LDCs and not the political representatives.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I remember at earlier m
eetings how these financial representatives fought for the [unintelligible] and abundance and favoring the less developed countries and the link which means printing up 
extra money for LDCs.   MR. WALLICH.  [Unintelligible] I think th
e growing differentiation of the middle- and 
higher-income LDCs from the othe
rs that brings about its improvements so long as they want to 
present a common front, which they™ve always done up ™til now.  They™ve got to drop these demands for a [debt] moratorium, demands for gua
rantees, which have been so troublesome.  I 
also was impressed that there™s re
latively little criticism of the 
comfortable [unintelligible] that the U.S. now occupies in the international moneta
ry system of a floating dollar, reserve currency, 
10/19/76 - 4 - 
[unintelligible] no convertibility obligations.  It™s a nice spot for the U.S. to be in, and I thought there™d be some criticism of th
is, but I didn™t hear much.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Now, regarding my visit to China and Japan, 
[unintelligible] I learned someth
ing about China.  It™s fascinating.  Reminded me most of the 
people of Israel--as Leviticus records, Moses was 
able to call on the people of Israel to become a 
holy people.  That is a move in the nation [tha
t] I thought I detected.  How widespread it is, I can™t say.  Certainly it isn™t universal within the struggle between the so-c
alled idealists and the [unintelligible] if it were universal.   What has been taking place in China--essential
ly, I think it is terrible to change human 
nature.  I think that™s what has been happening in China under Chairman Mao.  Here is a country 
that asks its people to build up the strength of China on their own and without foreign assistance of any kind.  And they will do it on their own; if it™s worth doi
ng, they will do it on their own.  They don™t want any grants, they don™t want any loans.  And [for] that enormous earthquake 
disaster, which according to various estimat
es--and I should say these are not wild guesses--easily exceeded 500,000 deaths, China refused to accept any medicine, any help of any 
sort from any other country.   
That™s symbolic of the attitude.  Individuals have been taught to believe that, first, this 
nation must rely on its own strengt
h.  That individuals are not to pursue personal goals or, to put it a little differently, the chief pe
rsonal goal would be to serve one™s neighbor and to serve the nation.  And it™s a highly [egalitarian] society, to 
the point where everybody seems to dress alike, 
men and women included.  The incomes are almost equal.   
The economy, well, it™s a preponderately agricultural economy--80 per cent of the people are engaged in farming.  The farms are enormous
ly productive, as far as I could judge.  Every square inch of land has been utilized, cultivation is very intensive.  In Peking, right in the heart 
of the city, they have one farm after another.  
In Shanghai, at the airport, they have concrete strips, and they have grass in between, and the grass was being harvested--what kind of grain was being harvested, I couldn™t gather.  The people seem to work hard.   
The shops [unintelligible] thoroughly impossible to get much useful information in talking 
to economists and government officials.  Actual
ly, I was denied access to the university.  But 
that™s not unusual.  I went from shop to shop to 
see what was being sold at what prices.  And the shops are filled with merchandise; you don™t see 
empty shelves.  And much of the merchandise 
is of high quality.  You can now buy in a Chinese store a Swiss watch, a rather expensive one, if you™ve got the money, very few do, but the watche
s are there.  You can buy a fur coat, you can buy a television set, you can buy a radio, buy photographic equipment.  One thing is clear about 
[unintelligible] and Chinese people do buy bicycles.  Bicycles cost about $75, and with an average wage, quite typical wage of $30, that means two and a half months pay.   
Now the prices to Americans are--I do have 
a Chinese bug, stay away from me--the prices 
to an American are extraordinarily
 low.  I took a party of six to dinner, and including beer and wine and 10 sumptuous courses, $25.  The price of
 a serviceable pair of shoes is about $6, and that is close to a week™s wage.  The prices are no
t low to a Chinese.  When I got off the plane in 
Tokyo on the way back, John [unintelligible] who was 
with me [unintelligibl
e] namely he™d just 
10/19/76 - 5 - 
gotten a haircut in Tokyo, and it cost him $10.  I told him I had news for him, [in China] I got a 
haircut and a shave and it cost me 30 
cents.  Well, I could go on and on.   
But let me say two very brief comments.  I ha
d a three-hour meeting with the officials of 
the Bank of China, and it was a friendly, candid meeting, and this is something I was told 
couldn™t happen in China [unintelligible] and terribly nonpolitical.  And propaganda or anything [unintelligible]. I found the central bankers extremely well informed about traditions of this 
country and [elsewhere] abroad.  Very well informed about the gold market, foreign exchange 
markets around the world.  The [unintelligible] as 
interested, perhaps neither one of us is, and prospective economic trends in this c
ountry and prospective developments.   
In fact, you know, I was fascinated, it was so clear to me [unintelligible] of the news 
breaking about the U.S., I knew so little about China.  Of course, they get the 
Federal Reserve 
Bulletin and other publications, and we are not given access to their statistical records.  We don™t 
know what they have.  I will make available to 
the Committee in due course a report on how this 
conversation took place, particularly the infe
rence which was expressed [unintelligible] of 
exchanging information and developing contacts in 
a free country.  I found that very heartening.  In Japan, I saw the leaders of the Japa
nese government, Mr. [unintelligible] and 
[unintelligible] and also their central banker, what™s his name 
[Mr. Morinaga].  [I had] a particularly valuable discussion with Mr. Makuda,
 who almost certainly [will] very soon [be] the 
next prime minister of Japan.  He is a sound fi
nancial banker and fully understands that Japan now faces a new environment, that growth rates of 10 or 12 percent, such as Japan experienced 

during the postwar period, are out of the question for at least the n
ear-term future.  And [he] fully understands the need to curb inflation, which is running at a rate of close to 10 per cent or thereabouts in Japan.  [The] business commun
ity is unhappy [unintelligible] economic policy, 
and they™d like lower interest ra
tes.  They would like a cut in ta
xes and the [unintelligible] almost 
certainly will exist.   
I think that™s about all I can usefully say at this time.  As 
I say, as soon as I can get around to it, I will distribute some notes on the convers
ations I had with the officials of the Bank of China.  Mr. Wallich, you did some traveling, woul
d you like to say a word or two on your travels 
outside of Manila.    MR. WALLICH.  There are two.  I went 
to Hong Kong, [unintelligible], Sidney, and Canberra.  I inquired wherever I could about banking arrangements with respect to two things:  
the foreign reaction to the proposed foreign banki
ng legislation in the U.S. and examination and 
supervisory arrangements of Amer
ican [unintelligible] subsidiaries representatives.  I found no great excitement about the U.S. banking legi
slation.  With respect to the examination 
arrangements, I found on the whole that they se
em to be going forward, at least one would 
assume that they [unintelligible] that is not th
e case.  How complete they are, obviously I can™t say, [unintelligible] that there was a degree of
 normality about what was reported and was 
encouraging.   A less encouraging element is what one hears 
about LDC indebtedness and the attitude of bankers.  Apparently, American bankers [were] tr
aveling around, which is no great surprise, after Manila.  But what is surprising is that apparently they [were] pressing loans upon countries.  And 10/19/76 - 6 - 
here at home we hear that they 
can™t place loans [unintelligible] pr
ices of raw materials rise, the 
exports of these countries rise, their credit capacity seems better, and there™s pressure for more 
lending.  This is just the opposite, of course, of what we™ve been telling the LDCs and telling ourselves in Manila.  That this is a time for 
adjustment rather than 
financing, that too much financing of large balance of payments deficits
 has been going on, that the stronger countries must now take on their part of the deficit burden that the [oil-price increase] is imposing on the 
world.  So I think here is something that 
one needs to worry about, both the level of indebtedness, the prospects for rolling over, and apparently the view, I™m not saying [of] all 
bankers, but just a general report, the banking pressure to place more loans rather than to bear 
down on [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™m very much in
terested in that, and I had been hoping by now our bankers, who I think have gone hog-wild on lending to LDCs and to Eastern Europe, would be becoming more cautious.  From what 
you tell me--that they™re traveling around and 
trying to drum up demands for credit and to unloa
d the facilities that they have on others--I find that terribly disheartening.  I think we™re build
ing up [unintelligible] possibility to recover.  [Unintelligible] any comments on additional travel?  
SPEAKER(?).  Well, I™ll make one additional comment on your comment and Governor 
Wallich™s comment.  I don™t know if it™s a fair ge
neralization or not, Henry--I found the ones that 
are most aggressive [unintelligible] loans are 
the underwriters, the middl
emen, who would like to 
place some loans of developing countries with the banks.  But they don™t have any continuing 

exposure; when they get their commission, they
 get out.  I find the banks, I don™t think it™s uniform, but some of them anyway are feeling a 
bit more nervous and cautious than they were, 
but they [unintelligible] selling by now, I don™t.   I just have the impression that the most aggr
essive ones at the moment are the investment 
bankers.  The commercial bankers were getting a lit
tle more cautious.  But [unintelligible] I do 
know there are some aggressive investment ba
nkers going around.  I just stopped at a very few countries quickly on the way to Manila, mostly 
in the developed world.  I observed that India was doing very well.  Production is up, prices are the same as they 
were a year ago, reserves are increasing by 100 million a month.  [Unintelligible].   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Profits are being made--  

SPEAKER(?).  And they feel 
a little better about investme
nt, I think--they won™t admit that, yet--about foreign investment.  Help [unintelligible], but the observation I wanted to make 

was, I was struck by--I got two [unintelligible] in every stop I made, however brief.  They could 
all quote precisely Mr. Carter™s quotation from 
Playboy
, that was fact number one.  Fact number 
two, very quickly on the heels of that was last week™s money suppl
y figures, whatever last week was, down to the decimal point.  Whatever dist
ant place in the world [unintelligible] followed 
this quite so closely.   SPEAKER(?).  Is that because the 
Wall Street Journal™s out there now?  
10/19/76 - 7 - 
SPEAKER(?).  Well, whether it™s done by 
telex, well, in one meeting, somebody came 
running, ﬁIt™s just been published,ﬂ the last money supply figure.  
Whatever [unintelligible] to 
know right away.  Everybody up and down in those central banks looks for it.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, facts that rule th
e financial world [unintelligible].  Well, 
we™re finally ready for you, Mr. Pardee.  You™ve waited patiently. MR. PARDEE.  I hate to break the mood with my usual list of horrors from the exchange 
market here.   
MR. PARDEE.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very muc
h.  Any questions?  Yes, Mr. Black. 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Pardee, do you share what you described as the market™s assessment of 
the revaluation of the mark 
as being too little too late? MR. PARDEE.  In order to resolve the current situation, yes.  But I wouldn™t know how far to go in order to resolve the current market situation.  I think more depends on the other measures that have been taken over the course
 of recent months to deal with the underlying 
problems:  the tightening of monetary policies, the 
tightening of fiscal policies.  There have been a number of measures in dealing with the basic 
wage cost push that these countries have.  But they had hoped to buy some time with this; I™m not 
sure that they did--that they bought sufficient time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions?  All right, you have no recommendations?  
Very well, the motion to approve the transactions of the Desk will now be in order. 
SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been made
.  Seconded.  I hear no objection.  I™m 
rearranging the agenda some.  
Let us move on to a report by 
Mr. Sternlight on domestic open 
market operations. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Statement--see Appendix.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Sternlight.  Any questions?  Yes, Mr. MacLaury. 
MR. MACLAURY.  I want to ask Peter about the comment that he had made on the 
volume of repurchase agreements and reverse repu
rchase agreements.  Did I understand that now 
these are made in some rather sizable amounts,
 not only to even out what we think we know about technical factors in the market, but also
 the market™s perception of what the reserve 
availability is?  It seems to me
 this is one step further that we are going in the direction of maintaining a constant fed funds rate.  Is 
that the intent of these additional repos? MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think there is an elemen
t of that, Mr. MacLaury.  I don™t think it™s all that new.  We have sometimes engaged in
 operations to head off a change of market 
sentiment or to foster a change that we thought
 was warranted, even when the reserve projection 
10/19/76 - 8 - 
that we were looking at didn™t seem to call for 
that action.  But there seemed to be several 
occasions, a few occasions of that type, that 
called for rather large-scale action, and this, I 
thought, was of sufficient magnitude to
 call it to the Committee™s attention. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you.  Mr. Eastburn. MR. EASTBURN.  Peter, I would have inferred from your action that 
the Desk gave more 
weight to what happened to M1 than to
 M2.  Is that a correct inference? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  No, President Eastburn.  We were combining the two, giving weight 
to both as weekly information comes in, compari
ng the performance of both of those measures to 
the ranges set for them.  Had we looked at M1
 alone, I think the responses would have been earlier and more pronounced.  The relative strength of M2 was a tempering influence on the 
extent of our responses. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All righ
t, Mr. Kimbrel now, please. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Sternlight, what was the general market reaction to your 
determination to try for no option for 
early redemption of [unintelligible]. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I believe it was quite favorable.  The market well understood the reasons for which we wanted to do this.  We 
got what we thought were quite good rates.  We 
were concerned that perhaps we would have to 
accept considerably lower interest rates in order 
to impose that no-withdrawal condition on the ma
rket, and we found it did not call for a major 
differential.  Just a few basis points seemed to be
 sufficient, and it gave us a greater measure of 
assurance for that portion of our repurchase agreement injection. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Wallich, please. 

MR. WALLICH.  With respect to the nonborro
wed reserve experiment
, which apparently would have produced a somewhat perverse federa
l funds rate behavior toward the end of the period--is that on the basis of an unchanged path of nonborrowed reserves enunciated at the beginning of the period?  Or could the path ha
ve been modified in the light of evolving 
developments? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  That would be with respect to a path that was developed at the start of the period.  We did not cons
ider modifications of the path as we went along.  One could map 
out a procedure for modifying that path if one wished. 
MR. WALLICH.  Yes, so that it is perhaps not
 quite as negative a comment as it appears 
from this experience. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Depending on what procedure one followed in modifying the paths.  
Yes, I think that™s right. MR. WALLICH.  Yes. 
10/19/76 - 9 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question?  Any comment?  You know we™re indebted to you, Mr. Sternlight, for your report, and the moti
on to approve the actions of the Desk can now be in order. SPEAKER(?).  Moved. 

SPEAKER(?).  Seconded. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The motion™s been made
 and seconded.  I take it there is no objection.  Let™s turn now to Mr. Gramley™
s report on the state of the economy.   
MR. GRAMLEY.  [Secretary's not
e: This statement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much, Mr
. Gramley.  Well, we are now ready for 
our evaluation as a Committee of the state of the 
economy, and I think it™s 
particularly important 
that we indicate agreement or disagreement, and 
the reasons for such agreement or disagreement, 
with Mr. Gramley™s report.  We™ll hear first from 
[unintelligible] and then from Dave Lilly.  I™m 
sorry--Mr. Black. 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to 
ask a few questions of clarification.  Lyle, what do you estimate to have been the effect 
of the auto strike on industrial production in September?  You combine this with a settlement
 of the rubber strike and the bituminous coal 
strike. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Right.  We estimated that th
e auto strike reduced industrial production by 1/2 percent in September.  And there was a 2/10 
offset because of the settlement of the rubber 
strike and the bituminous coal strike. 
MR. BLACK.  And my second question, do 
you have any figures on the implicit price deflator for the third quarter or the fixed-weight deflator? MR. GRAMLEY.  The implicit price deflator is
 lower than we had estimated, and this 
accounts principally, in the mechanical sense, fo
r the difference in real GNP estimates for the 
third quarter.  The nominal increase in gross na
tional product published this morning is almost 
identical to what we had estimated as a staff. 
 But the GNP deflator, according to these figures, went down from 5.2 percent in the second 
quarter to 4.4 percent in the third. MR. BLACK.  What about the fi
xed weight?  Do you have that? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  The fixed-weight 
deflator also was lower than we had estimated.  I just 
got that number a moment ago.  Their figure is 
4.4 percent also for the gross business product fixed-weight deflator. MR. PARTEE.  What kind of increase do th
ey show for business fixed investment? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  In nominal terms, it™s quit
e close to ours.  In nominal terms, 
nonresidential investment goes up from 157.9 to 162.5.  
So that™s 4.6, if my arithmetic is right.  
10/19/76 - 10 - 
In real terms, it goes up from 114.9 to 117.0.  Those 
figures are very close to what our staff has been using. MR. PARTEE.  About a 7 percent rate of increase. MR. GRAMLEY.  Something like that. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, tha
nk you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Lilly please. 
MR. LILLY.  Well, as some of you know, I have
 been concerned about the uneasiness and the uncertainty in the economy for the last seve
ral months, and I asked Lyle and Jerry if they 
would not modify some of their near-term a
ssumptions and construct a new scenario which would be more consistent with a straight extrapolation of what we™ve been experiencing in the last--since about last June.   Well, their first exercise, they persuaded me
, was perhaps a little too strenuous, so they came up with some modifications
 of their near-term [unintel
ligible] assumptions, which may 
very well be more consistent wi
th what™s going to happen than what we assume is going to 
happen.  In this they came up with a saving rate to rise slightly in ™77, business fixed investment 
to rise 10-1/2 percent, 6 percent real, rather than the 15-1/2 percent which they have now; net exports reduced by about $4 billion--1/3 of what we have in ™77; and residential construction activity in real terms conti
nues to rise early in ™77 but edges back later on.   The effect of all of this, and the reason that I had this done, was to give me a downside risk 
factor, and the effect of it is a real growth of GNP at about 2-1/2 percent annual rate over the next five quarters, versus the 5 percent in the Greenbook.  And it leaves the unemployment rate 
at 7-3/4 percent at the end of ™77, about 1 percentage point above the projected level.  This is closer to my view of wh
at is likely to happen than the staff™s projections. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It might be of interest 
to--I have before me this morning™s release 
by the Commerce Department on the national income accounts.  Let me read one sentence which 

indicates the margin of error that
 attaches to your current estimate
s:  ﬁBased on past experience, it is likely that the third-quarter change in real GNP, now estim
ated at 4 percent at an annual rate, will not be revised above 6 percent or below 2.6 percent next July.ﬂ  Well, that™s well worth 
keeping in mind.  In other words, there is uncer
tainty not only about the future, but there is significant uncertainty even about the very recent 
past.  So, the kind of difference that Mr. Lilly has suggested [between] his own view of the economic future and the staff view should not be 
surprising.  Mr. MacLaury next, please. MR. MACLAURY.  I have a couple of questions, Lyle.  The extent to which the housing starts in the multifamily area picked up [in] th
e latest month reported was surprising, and I 
wondered whether artificial stimulus from govern
ment programs was playing any major part in 
explaining why multifamily starts seemed to be racing ahead? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are you referring to the August figure? MR. MACLAURY.  I™m trying to remember which ar
e the latest starts figures.  I think we 
would have September by now, wouldn™t we? 
10/19/76 - 11 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  September figures 
to be released at 2:00 p.m. today. 
MR. MACLAURY.  I do not have those.  It must be August that I had in mind. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  All I can say in response to th
at question, President MacLaury, is that I have heard that story only very recently.  We ha
ve begun to look into it, and we will plan to 
report back to the Committee as soon as we ascertain anything definite. 
MR. MACLAURY.  My second question was-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  May I--before you go on--I have the September figure, but I™m 
honor bound not to release it.  I can say, however, that a truly dramatic 
increase in both housing starts and building permits will be reported this 
afternoon and what the interpretation may be is 
another question.  Mr. Partee called my attention to the possible disturbance in these figures arising from governmental actions
 I was not aware of, and you referred to the same thing.  And 
as yet, our staff has not analyzed the figures and whether it w
ould be possible to segregate the housing starts attributable to governmental 
programs or not.  I don™t know.  I don™t have 
sufficiently precise command over t
hose figures to be able to say, but our staff is going to look into it.  They probably will not have an answer today. 
MR. MACLAURY.  My second question, then, had to do with the lag in government 
expenditures, which Lyle has already told us he has not been able to pierce the veil on--as others apparently have not--as to why this $13 billion rate of lag.  I suppose that makes it impossible to 
say whether this is likely to be reversed, whether we™re going to come back to sort of a trend 
path, whether we™re going to make up for past
 undershoots without knowing what™s the cause of it.  I suppose there™s nothing that can be said in that respect, but I™m still very curious, and the 
effect of that lag on output and the lag in the economy as a whole.  I thought that the Greenbook 
was implying that the lag was in interest payments
 on the national debt and in transfer payments 
to state and local governments. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I believe it™s fair to say, 
President MacLaury, that the lag is quite 
widespread.  It is not primarily concentrated in pu
rchases, it™s in other things besides purchases.  But it™s quite widespread.  We do think it™s ha
d something to do with a slowdown in economic 
activity in terms of the impact 
on disposable income much mo
re than through its impact on 
purchases.  As to why it™s happening, we are at a loss to give any 
definite answer.   The best explanation that I have heard, but it™s a hypothesis for which I have no support, is 
that government agencies generally 
did not take into account the decline in the rate of inflation 
on their expenditures.  But I don™t kn
ow that that™s the case.  If that™s the case, we might well see 
some continuing shortfall from expectations go on. 
 Now, we have reduced our projected level of unified budget outlays for fiscal 1977 by $2 billion.  But that would mean some rebound in the 
rate of spending over the remainde
r of the fiscal year, and that
 may prove to be inaccurate. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Just as an informati
onal item, this morning™s national income 
report reads as follows on governmental purchase
s:  ﬁThe Federal Government purchases of 
goods and services rose by $3.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with $2 billion in the 
10/19/76 - 12 - 
second quarter.  Spending increased $1.7 billion on defense, and $1.5 billion on the rest.  State and local government purchases, on the other ha
nd, were up $4.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with $5.4 [billion] in the second quarter.ﬂ
  A fuller story will be needed.  You™d have 
to go back to the first quarter to see the r
ecent developments in governmental spending as 
reported in the national income account; you™d have
 to go back a little earlier to judge the magnitude of the restraint on spending that 
has been in force.  Mr. Coldwell please. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I find myself
 in a kind of an in-between position [relative to] those who have already spoken.  I sense a feeling of unhappiness in Lyle™s report, but not nearly so deep as Governor Lilly™s position.  I don™t think, from my viewpoint, the 
economy is going to roar [during] the rest of ™76. 
 I™m just optimistic that what will happen in ™77 
will be an improvement for us.  I don™t think that 
we face a recession in the real growth rate, and 
yet I™m not terribly happy with the prospects that 
the staff gives us and certainly not that which Governor Lilly portrays.  The unemployment rate is much higher th
an I care to have it, and yet the inflation rate continues also.   
It seems to me that if you look down the road, 
we™ve got a pause.  The pause is disturbing.  
It™s been disturbing in the past, and perhaps we may be saddled with this for the rest of 1976.  
But I™m basically optimistic about what happens in
 ™77, and I didn™t want to be associated with quite as strong a position as the staff portrayed last time or this time, but neither do I want to take 
on the recession scenario that Governor Lilly seems to be showing. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I thou
ght he stopped short of that. MR. COLDWELL.  Not short of 
a recession.  Well, in my view, that™s almost a recession, 
from the pointing out of a problem. 
MR. LILLY.  I have a recession scenario if you™d like it. MR. COLDWELL.  I thank you for it, but I don™t believe I want that either.  No, I think the 
economy is not doing as well as I™d hoped it would, but
 that™s been my story for several months.  
I™ve been hoping that we would find a little more
 room to expand.  But we™ll talk about policy 
later on. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we™re in the midst of
 a discussion that should and will take a significant amount of time.  But perhaps we ought
 to break now for coffee and then return. [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We are engaged in a very important discussion today on the state 
of the financial economy, and in the course of
 our discussion we may 
want to broaden our analysis and look at the international economy.  Mr. Kimbrel, let 
us hear from you now, please. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, I believe my 
question was answered in the response to 
President MacLaury with regard to the possibl
e injection of additional expenditures for the 
shortfall and [unintelligible], and I believe Mr. Gramley suggested that the projections do 
indicate some slight [unintellig
ible], but that was my problem. 
10/19/76 - 13 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimbrel, Mr. Morris please. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, until about tw
o weeks ago I was willing to accept the 
slower growth rate in the economy as a normal 
cyclical phenomenon which 
often occurs in the stage of an expansion as the thrust of the inventory cycle diminish
es.  But it seems to me that the 
evidence that™s come in the past few weeks sugge
sts that there is a basis for somewhat more 
concern than I had a month ago.  I was quite su
rprised at the breadth of the weakness in the leading indicators in August.  Only housing indicators showed any strength, and the breadth of weakness in all of the other indicators was, I think, evidence that we ought to be alert to the possibility that the economy is going to go 
more slowly than we had talked about.   
I have been looking into the little evidence that we have as to what has been happening in September and October for some sign that this 
August weakness was being reversed, and I have yet to see any real evidence that, apart from th
e housing sector, we are seeing a turnaround.  It seems to me that, even though Mr. Gramley is not
 a devotee of leading indicators, we have arrived at essentially the same position by a different
 means.  I do agree with the analysis that the 
risk of forecast error on the downside is more seri
ous than I had thought in the past two months.   
And one other thing.  Of course, it disturbs me, looking at the new 
projections which the staff has given us, that--granted all the problems in projecting to 
the end of ™77--we are looking at a number of 4.7 as the latest staff projection of
 real growth in 1977.  I think that, for the first time, we have a projection from the staff that 
is too low to be acceptable by this Committee as a 
target.  I think a 4.7 percent real growth rate is slower than we need to deal simultaneously with 
the inflation rate.  Obviously, if you are talking about 7, I™d be concerned that it is too high, but I think 4.7 is too low.   Now, the problem, it seems to me, is not the thre
at of recession.  I don™t think that we have 
any of the characteristics in the 
economy that would lead us to have a concern for that.  I think 
the problem is a sluggishness in th
e rate of growth.  And it seems 
to me that the risk there is 
much higher than I would have contemplated a month ago or two weeks ago.   Finally, on this reference to the Michigan survey of consumer sentiment, I™d like to point 
out that not all the surveys are showing these results.  The Sindlinger survey, which is done on a weekly basis, is showing a continued deterioration in consumer confidence. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Which survey? 

MR. MORRIS.  Sindlinger. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well-- 

MR. MORRIS.  Could I say something about Mr
. Sindlinger?  Now, Mr. Sindlinger is in many respects a crank.  He takes these numbers and 
tries to forecast the stoc
k market, the rate of 
growth of the money supply, and so on.  And so
 as far as his analysis of these numbers, he 
verges on the absurd, if not going beyond the line.  But nonetheless, [for] all of the weaknesses of Mr. Sindlinger as an analyst, I have found his numbers, bare
 of his interpretation, to be extremely useful and quite sensitive to the cu
rrent mood of the consumer.  For this reason I 
10/19/76 - 14 - 
would tend to downgrade, or at least water down, the findings of the Michigan survey, which are 
considerably older. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I too have followed this Mr. Sindlinger, and I have made an 
effort to interest our staff in Mr. Sindlinger.  They have made studies, wh
ich I have not reviewed, and I have been informed of th
eir conclusions repeatedly, and th
eir conclusions with regard to Mr. Sindlinger™s work in this area and others remain negative.  
Therefore I continue to look at his indicator of consumer confiden
ce [unintelligible] view with staff opinion.  The value of that indicator--I would not announce that publicly because I think you
™re taking a certain risk, you 
see, for your reputation, just as I am now 
taking similar risks with you by announcing any 
interest at all in Mr. Sindlinger. 
MR. MORRIS.  Well I, let 
me say I didn™t work-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And I must say that I li
ke to look at nuisances from all directions 
and pay attention to crackpots--after all, the wise people of this world have misled us over the 
years and maybe the crackpots will lead us on to a path of rectitude. 
MR. MORRIS.  Well, I just wondered, Mr. 
Chairman, whether the staff was biased 
because of the absurdity of his interpretation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Our staff does not know the meaning of bias. 
MR. MORRIS.  I™ve been following his numbers for a few years, and I found them very 
useful. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Baughman now please. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, just a coupl
e of quick observations which may be of 
interest.  One:  We had expected by this time to 
see a return flow of dollars from Mexico, that™s 
not materialized, and we continue to see the 
reverse, actually--a fair
ly sizable demand for 
dollars-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Say, incidentally, did you inform the Committee, in your report, 
about the entire Mexico payment back to us? 
MR. PARDEE.  Yes--that they paid us and that they drew on the Treasury line. MR. BAUGHMAN.  It appears that even at 
the current exchange rate, there are some 
holders of pesos who still desire to get into dollars.  With respect to the generally weak loan 
demand, we are seeing a reverse in
 the agricultural areas, with strong loan demands.  And the 
country banks, of course, are rather happy about 
that because they have both strong deposits and 
strong loans.   Turning to the current economic outlook, it se
ems to me a very difficult problem is 
captured in Lyle Gramley™s comment that he 
doesn™t think we can [deal with] the current 
lethargic situation in the economy through monetary policy.  I thi
nk I agree with that.  But it doesn™t give one any peace of mind.  Particularly
, there is a little different situation in the 10/19/76 - 15 - 
outlook we are looking at currently than what we™ve been looking at in the past.  Mainly that we were looking at a rising rate of inflation rather than a diminishing 
rate of inflation.  Now, it just 
seems to me that the possibiliti
es of continuing very low levels of performance, or maybe of 
even what you call stagnation--if we are in fact
 looking into a fairly ex
tended period of rising rather than declining prices, [t
hose possibilities are] substantially increase
d.  And unless we can find some way of impacting upon that trend in 
prices, that the possibilities of moving the 
economy toward that desired objective of full em
ployment and price stability become more and 
more remote.   
Well, all I™m doing here is expressing, I guess, frustration and concern and what I think is the major aspect of the additional concern that I 
see in our current projection.  That™s all I have, 
Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Mr. Mayo now, please. MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, an ob
servation.  As an ex budget director, I think Lyle is on the right track in his feeling that the most logical explanation of the underspending at the federal level is, if I may use the term, 
budget padding by the agencies in terms of their 
inflation assumptions that are 
never stated, probably, even by the OMB.  And again I have no knowledge of this, it is just surmis
ed, but it seems to me a very logi
cal chain of events that would lead to an explanation of the 
present underspending level.   I find that I share substantia
lly Lyle™s comparing the Greenbook forecast of just several 
months ago with the very little changed Greenb
ook forecast today in terms of risks that are 
involved--he felt we were likely to exceed our estimat
es of two or three months ago, with the risk much greater on the downside now.  I like this fo
rmulation in my own mind because it gives me 
a separation of a--granted--judgmental forecast, but 
with an added fillip of
 judgment that can™t 
really be quantified at all.   On the other hand, while defending this approach, I must say, well, that™s an economist for 
you.  Why doesn™t he change his figures instead of
 just reappraising the risk as being greater on the one side in one case and greater on the other side
 in the other case?  He is telling us, in effect, 
that the outlook is not so good as it was two or th
ree months ago, and it™s not nearly as good as 
the comparison of the figures would indicate.  I 
was wondering if Lyle had any comment on that.   
MR. GRAMLEY.  I object to that interpretati
on, President Mayo.  I do think one needs to distinguish between one™s best-guess forecast an
d what probability he attaches to it and the 
probability distribution that you™ve 
had with various forecasts.  Our best-guess forecast is what™s 
in the Greenbook now.  If we thought that the best guess at this point was that the economy 
would be weaker than that, we would have weakened our forecast more than we did.  This is our 

best guess at the present time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think Mr. Mayo has raised a very interesting theoretical question, which I will rephrase as follows:  Suppose that the probability attached to successive forecasts is 

held constant?  In that case, assuming that this 
is possible, would not the forecast itself now be lower than Lyle has put it to you?  That™s e
ssentially your question.  And the real theoretical issue is whether you could hold probability constant. 10/19/76 - 16 - 
MR. GRAMLEY.  We have no probability. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I know that.  It™s not what you™ve done, it™s not what you™re going 
to do, it™s the question as to what you might do if
 it were at all a possibi
lity--to hold probability 
constant.  Is that technically possible? MR. MAYO.  That™s my question. 

MR. GRAMLEY.  If I interpret you
r statements correctly, yes, I 
think the answer is yes, it 
is. 
MR. MAYO.  Is it operationally possible? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  It wouldn™t be easy for us to forecast it that way. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™m not sure it can 
be done at all, but [unintelligible] in the hour of leisure, if it ever comes, you would ha
ve thought this question through, and I would like to know your best answer.  Any other comment, Mr. Mayo?  Mr. Winn now, please. 
MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, I hate to be th
e voice of contrary opinion around here, but our actions remind me of weather forecasters taking 
barometric readings in August and September 
and predicting November weather.  We did a very
 brief and unscientific phone survey of retail sales yesterday, and I was amazed to discover abou
t a 20 percent increase for the first weeks in 
October.  It was a surprise to the merchants as
 well as to everybody else.  This is [relative to] September figures, and this is [relative to] a 
year ago, and October a year ago was quite good.  There has been a lot of sales effort, but there are also some changes in merchandising factors 
underneath.  For example, they are able to offe
r merchandise at $25 with a full markup that three 
months ago they were trying to sell at $39.  That kind of change is very significant, and men™s 
and women™s clothing has been ve
ry slow [but] has moved very
 well in October.  I™m not 
predicting any boom in any sense the term, but I am
 concerned with the [data] lag problem that 
we face here. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This observation is based on precisely what interval during the month of October? 
MR. WINN.  These are up to yesterday™s sales 
in October, the first 
two weeks of October. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I see, the first two weeks 
of October.  Now, the retail figures that we have; what™s the latest public retail trade figure? MR. GRAMLEY.  The latest figure we have is 
for the week of October 9.  We have two 
[weekly] figures referring to the month of Oct
ober.  One [is for] the week ending [October] second, which showed an increase of 1.4 percent, and that was heavily in the durable goods area.  And the next week relative to the previous week showed a decline of 1.1, so that for the two weeks as a whole now, the latest fi
gure would be up just a little bit. MR. WINN.  The sample may be different. 
10/19/76 - 17 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You might have a di
fference in data, for October 9 and 14. MR. LILLY.  I brought this up at the business council.  They were attributing it to the coal strike. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  When was the meeting? 

MR. LILLY.  Last week.  Last Friday.  They were hoping that it was more than that, but at 
this point they™re attributing 
it to the coal strike.   
MR. WINN.  My second [question], Mr. Chairm
an, has to do with the automobile market, 
which has been basic here in terms of what™s happening to us consumerwise.  I™m personally still 
disturbed by the lengthening in the credit terms 
[that] are being evidenced as more widespread 
and the interest rates that ar
e being charged in this area. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are interest ra
tes being too low relative to-- 
MR. WINN.  They™ve never come down very gr
eatly, their interest rates on automobile 
paper. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Why should they come
 down in view of the lengthening of maturity? 
MR. WINN.  Well-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The risk is greater, 
so in effect they have come down. 
MR. WINN.  You™re probably ri
ght, it™s going to be a hard thing to sell the consumers 
when they realize what™s happening, but I think that™s something else again.  But I think there™s 
something also taking place, and that is that, with concern about fuel consumption and changing 

the size of cars, my guess is that instead of the 
second- and third-car kind of a family approach, 
you are going to see much more use of the leas
ing device as a way of providing transportation, with people leasing a large station wagon to take
 their vacation or their children to school, and not providing the second and third.  So the lengthening terms and the basic underlying change may lead to a change in the automobile market dow
n the road that hasn™t in
 fact [unintelligible] replacements. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  With increasing relianc
e on leasing, the volume of sales to those 
same people should come down. 
MR. WINN.  Come down, and this sort of th
ing providing the same 
transportation almost. MR. JACKSON.  You™re speaking of short-term leasing? 

MR. WINN.  That™s short-term leasin
g, that is correct
.  That™s right. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We thank Mr. Winn for 
the interesting observations.  Mr. Wallich 
now, please. 10/19/76 - 18 - 
MR. WALLICH.  I have two questions, if I ma
y.  One is very similar to Mr. Mayo™s.  I 
took Lyle™s statement to mean that what was pr
eviously the probability distribution of outcomes 
of the forecast was skewed upward with a tail 
for the higher forecast, now it™s skewed downward 
toward the lower forecast.   
I heard it said that the inventory situation is 
such that it [limits] 
a downward spiral.  And 
one could take Governor Lilly™s simulation as ev
idence that [unintelligible] doesn™t it seem to 
induce that kind of inventory liquidation?  Is that a reasonably correct interpretation?  Is the 
inventory situation putting a kind of floor under the s
ituation, so that even in a relatively bad case 
we don™t have to anticipate a severe downward spiral? MR. GRAMLEY.  Governor Wallich, I would 
say that the inventory situation would 
predispose towards avoiding a recession, but inventory-sales ratios are not extraordinarily low at the present time, particularly 
after you deflate them.  I would say that [unintelligible] has sufficient weakening of final sale
s, particularly in business fixed investment.  It often happens that inventories which look relatively low given the current basis of sales would look relatively high a few months later, when expectations of final sales are deteriorating.  So I think in the 
situation [unintelligible] is not conducive to 
the production of recession, but it certainly doesn™t 
make us recession proof. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, if the general answer is along the lines that you™ve indicated, let there be a sufficient decline in spending--m
akes no difference what the spending is on--and the inventories that look normal today would 
look excessive later on.  And then inventory liquidation would follow.  This does assume--to tu
rn from this abstract proposition to judgment 
about the economy--I think, more of
 a negative movement in th
e economy than Governor Lilly 
assumed in his projection.  He still had growth of 2-1/2 percent. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Mr. Chairman, may I take the 
opportunity to correct one remark that I 
made earlier.  I said our mean probability--this is
 our best mean forecast.  What I meant is the 
modal probability is still the one
--the highest modal probability 
is the one we attach to the 
present forecast, not the mean.  The one with th
e highest probability is the mode not the mean. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now you trouble me. 

MR. PARTEE.  Do you take votes among the staff? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are you that precise that you can distinguish the mode and the mean? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  In a technical sense, yes. 

MR. WALLICH.  This is very important in re
sponse to my question.  I assumed that it was 
the mode and not the mean when I talked of the 
tail on one side or the other.  If you take the mean, then it™s somewhere on the downward sloping end of the tail. 
You said, Lyle, that you did not think monetary policy was 
responsible for the slowdown; credit had been available, interest rates have been moderate.  
Have you weighed this against the fact that in this expansion, mone
y has been created very largely 
against purchases of securities 10/19/76 - 19 - 
by the banking system rather than by loans, so th
at in the first round effect, as it were, money creation has not generated a demand for goods and 
services but merely 
increased the pool of available capital and then flows into other assets?  Do you regard this difference in the form of 
money creation as a significant difference in 
the way the monetary expansion has proceeded? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Governor Wallich, I believ
e the reason that banks are using their 
increased deposits to buy securities rather than lo
ans reflects two things.  First, the fact that 
businesses have wanted to [conduct their] external financing in longer-term markets. 
Three things, I guess; three reasons.   
Second, because their external financing needs have been small given what has been 
happening to internally generated funds and the rate of investment
.  Third, that banks have been unwilling to make the concession on the prime rate 
necessary to generate larger business loan 
demands.  That latter point is th
e only element which would lead one
 to suggest, I think, that the degree of monetary expansion we have had may ha
ve been in some sense less expansive than if 
the banks had put their prime rate down and gotte
n additional loans.  But my guess would be that if the banks had done this, the principal difference would have been in terms of the distribution 
of funds used by businesses--they would have 
borrowed more at banks and less in the open 
market.  I don™t really think that
™s an element which would be s
uggestive of moneta
ry restraint. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallic
h and Mr. Gramley.  Mr. Partee now, 
please. 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I™ve been 
gone for a little while, and I was disturbed about the economy, the outlook, before I left but
 hopeful that there would be improving signs.  
But now I find myself looking at what seems to be
 a softer economy than [in] the period before.  
Incidentally, as I read [them], the staff projecti
ons are materially lower.
  A few months ago we 
were adjusting to a second-quarter GNP increase that was a good deal less than had been anticipated.  But we were saying that the third quarter would show good strength.  Now we™re adjusting to a third-quarter GNP that is lower than had been an
ticipated, and we™re not expecting increased compensating strength further on out, so therefore the level of real GNP must be lower 
throughout the projection than it was six months ago.  Is that right, Lyle? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, six months ago we we
ren™t projecting out through the end of 1977.  We made our first projectio
n through 1977 in July.  You are quite correct.  At that time 
our projection for the third quarter and for, I believe, the fourth quarter, too, was higher than it is now.  And indeed our projection for the four quarters of 1977 is a shade lower.  No question that real GNP by the end of 1977 is lower than we were projecting in July. MR. PARTEE.  Well, I wanted to make that cl
ear because I think we have to be concerned 
not only about the rates of increase in real GNP but also ab
out the levels of resource utilization--in particular, labor force utilizati
on--that the projection implies.  And it implies a 
little less utilization than it did 
back awhile.  And that™s somewhat associated with Frank™s 
comment about, well, it™s getting to the point where the projection isn™t really one that we can accept as a target.   
10/19/76 - 20 - 
Well, as I look at what™s happened, I guess I have three main points that do disturb me 
compared to a couple of months ago.  The first is
 that there is now pretty strong evidence of a slowing in personal income growth.  Before, we 
had a low June, but then it was pointed out that July would be strong, which it was because of Soci
al Security and then some other increases.  
Now we have August and September, which are also
 [showing] low rates of growth, so that in three of the last four months, th
e rates of growth for personal income have been distinctly low.  
To me that means that what™s happened is that 
the weakness in the economy is feeding back into jobs and income.  And when that begins to happ
en there™s a possibility that the poor performance 
of income will feed back into the economy, and 
there is more chance of a slowdown than would 
be true if you just had a very temporary kind of a pause of the kind we have had in previous 
recoveries.   The second thing I think bothers me quite a bit 
is the marked decline in the stock market.  
That doesn™t mean anything, really, by itself.  It
™s, I guess, 6 or 7 or 8 percent depending on what index you look at.  It isn™t an awful lot, but it is, I think, perhaps as good an indicator of mood as 
Mr. Sindlinger™s.  And the mood that [the stock 
market decline] tends to convey is not a good one.  Now with a rather protracted period of sluggishness in consumer markets on the one hand 
and a decline of some size in the stock market
 on the other hand, not massive, but some size, it 
seems to me that you have to raise questions
 about how strongly businessmen will pursue 
expansion on capital goods spending.  We™ve 
been depending on a capital goods boom, and I wouldn™t want to say that there™s not going to be an increase, but it seems to me that those two 
developments make the odds less for a large rise in
 business capital.  And so those two feed into that point.   
The third thing that I™m terribly shocked by, I mu
st say, because I really did lose sight of this while I was away, is the extremity of foreign responses to 
something--to weakness in their 
exchange rate, or defense of their system, or so
mething.  But as I look at the situation in many 
European countries I can™t believe that it™s possible there is not going to be a marked 
deterioration in real economic performance there 
compared with what we were expecting a few 
months ago.  I thought there would be a very good recovery in Europe.  But now with the bank rate 15 percent in the U.K., with 
Italy taking very restrictive actions, with France restrictive, with 
the Low Countries restrictive, I don™t believe there™s going to be a very good recovery, a continuing recovery, abroad.  And that will have 
an effect on our foreign trade.  There will be a 
deterioration there.   
So when I put it all together, I guess I have to conclude that I share a 
little bit in Governor Lilly™s experiment, and I think the odds are that 
there will be a rather poor period of growth in 
the economy.  Perhaps for three or four quarters.
  Whether or not there will be a recession, I 
don™t know.  I think the odds are against it because
 we don™t have the imbalances that we had 
before.  And so chances are that we™ll have a m
odest continuing rate of real growth, I think, at least for several quarters.  But it looks to me as though it™s going 
to be below the rate of real growth we need in order to apply [more of] our
 resources.  And so I think the Committee has to 
take that into account.    Now there is one other major uncertainty today th
at ought to be pointed out, and that is that we have more than the usual degree of uncerta
inty about government policy.  And therefore we 
can™t say whether there might be developments 
in government policy in the months ahead that 
10/19/76 - 21 - 
would modify in one direction or another the ki
nd of projections we™re now making, and I think 
we ought to keep that in mind.  Thank you.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee.  I would like to comment very briefly on 
two of your comments.  One is recent developments in personal income.  Now Lyle, please 
correct me if I™m wrong on these if you will.  I belie
ve that the decline in 
the rate of growth of nominal personal income has been accompanied by, 
and is partly explained by, a decline in the rate of increase of wages.   MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s correct.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s a healthy development.  Now, second, as for the 
foreign economy, in the case of Italy, some rest
rictive measures have been taken, and perhaps 
Italy™s gone as far as it can, given the political environment.  But 
on the fiscal side, all that Italy plans to do is to cut expenditures approximate
ly $100 million--it™s as small as that.   
MR. PARTEE.  Their [unintelligible] situation is pretty tight.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yeah, it is being tightened.  Now in the case of Britain, I don™t know that my conclusions are any different, but I would certainly arrive at them in a rather 
different way than you did.  Whether we like it or
 not, the fact of the matter is the financial 
people working around the world have very little confidence in the pound sterling.  The only way in which confidence in the pound sterling can be restored is by resorting to a highly restrictive monetary policy, highly restrictive financial policy, stop all of the nonsense about nationalizing industry, recreate some incentives for business pe
ople, business managers, particularly in the 
intermediate classes.  And that will mean a pinc
h in the real economy fo
r a while, but it™s the 
only way, in my judgment, that
 Great Britain can restore 
health to its economy.   
MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I was not
 commenting on the appropriateness of the policies of the individual countries.  I™m r
eally not in a position to judge them.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, that™s what I mea
n, we arrived at the same conclusion.   
MR. PARTEE.  What I did mean to imply is th
at there are rather sharp changes in a good many countries--not just with th
e U.K. [but] in a good many of those countries, and that I think 
that we have to consider the possibility that 
this will affect our expor
ts plan, directly and 
indirectly.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think adjustments that
 have been postponed in one country after another will have to be made.  I think also th
at the sluggishness that we see in our own economy 
is worldwide.  And when a phenomenon repeats itse
lf in one country after another, there are only two lines of explanation.  One is that sluggishness spreads from one country to others, and that undoubtedly is true in some part.  But there is a 
second line of explanation which I think is more 
fundamental, namely that there are common basi
c causes [shared by] individual countries around the world.  And the common basic cause, I think, is the fact that th
e world has experienced a very severe recession.  It was unexpected.  People around the world thought that was a thing of the past, it could no longer happen.  It did happen.  And as a result, businessmen here and elsewhere 
10/19/76 - 22 - 
have become cautious in managing their inventor
ies, they™ve become cautious in making plans 
for large new investments in fixed capital.   
Now before, I think that we™ve been mistaken
 in thinking that the economy in our country 
and the world could rebound quickly from th
e sharpness of the recession.  So I think 
sluggishness is a worldwide phenomenon now, a
nd the need the world around is to restore confidence, and the remedy will vary one country to 
another.  Britain™s problem is certainly very 
different from ours.  But classical remedies such
 as a liberal financial policy may no longer work 
in an environment in which inflation coexists wi
th recession or with sluggish expansion in the 
economy.  I don™t disagree with your conclusion.  
I just wanted to comment on probably the 
great necessity for the kinds of readjustments 
that are taking place around the world that have been postponed too long.   MR. PARTEE.  But it could also mean, Mr. Ch
airman, we have a sluggishness, an unusual 
degree of sluggishness, that you have to work hard to overcome.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Which you have to try to overcome.  You say working harder.  
Well, you have to work hard.  I™d say there is still a question whether monetary and fiscal policy 
is the right answer to the kind of environment in which we live.  To a degree perhaps.  But my 
own judgment is that modificat
ions of economic structure are 
probably necessary to restore economic health, and that highly expansive polic
ies are the difficulties from which we have 
suffered.   MR. WALLICH.  May I make a comment on th
is, Mr. Chairman?  In the light of the 
financial situation of many LDCs an
d also of industrial countries, it seems inevitable that in one 
way or another they reduce their deficit.  Now wh
at Chuck foresees is a form of doing that.  
Whichever they do, in one way or another, it probably means that a larger part of the OPEC- 
induced deficit is going to shift to the United States.  We™ve already taken a sizable amount, but 
we may have to take more that has to be f
actored realistically into our prospects.   MR. PARTEE.  Yes, that is a good way to put that, I agree with that totally.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich 
and Mr. Partee.  Mr. Eastburn, may we 
hear from you.   
MR. EASTBURN.  I™d like to follow up on the comments you just made, Mr. Chairman, 
and also refer to Lyle™s very intriguing comment
s about the efficacy of monetary policy in this 
current situation.  I think this includes Ernie and Henry as well.  I guess I™m less prepared to give up the faith in monetary policy in the situation we 
seem to be confronting, as Lyle indicated--that 
there are two disadvantages, one is that you may stim
ulate inflation if you ease further and that in any case you wouldn™t have any effect in the short run.  And I think those same arguments would 
apply at any time and may raise th
e question, even if the economy were to worsen, whether those 
two objections still wouldn™t exist.  Second comment is, if, 
in the present situation, monetary 
policy cannot be very effective, the question might be whether fiscal
 policy might be used to step 
in here.  Would you care to comment on that Lyle?   
MR. GRAMLEY.  I™ll be happy to.  I™d first lik
e to make certain th
at you understand that my statement of my position was a good deal more 
moderate than the way you put it.  That is, I 
10/19/76 - 23 - 
think monetary policy would have some positive e
ffect on economic activity in the near term, but 
that its effect in the near te
rm would be less than a similar 
dose of monetary expansion would 
have produced in the comparable stage of earlier cycles.   I think the housing industry is not one that is likely to respond much to easing monetary 
policy.  That is the area that, normally speaking, we
 expect the most stimulus to come from.  I 
think the stock market would be less likely now to 
respond to a decline in interest rates than it would have in the past four or five years.  I don™t see the evidence of credit restraint in the 
availability sense that one could counter by easing monetary policy.  I don™t 
see a lot of thrust in 
the short term.   
I want to make sure you understand that my co
mments about the inflationary impact are 
over the longer term, not in the short term.  I don™
t know of any way that money can affect prices without affecting economic activity.   
Turning to your second point, if I had the responsibility for moving over to the levers of 
fiscal policy, I would be inclined to move on the fiscal front.  And the direction in which I would move would be tax cuts.  Tax cuts which could be possibly of a temporary kind, perhaps a $50 
tax cut for each dependent.  Each taxpayer.  Something that would provide a stimulus, get this 
thing going again, get consumpti
on moving without undercutting the tax base for the longer run and without leading to the sorts of increases in expenditures which continue on and on and on because they™re very difficult to stop.  I do th
ink fiscal policy would be very helpful.   
MR. EASTBURN.  May I respond to the first part?  Seems to me, Lyle, the question 
is--and I don™t disagree with you, what you™ve [s
aid] about the immediate impact of monetary 
policy--seems to me it™s a matter of tradeoff.  
If the economy were to worsen--if your forecast 
were to get progressively more pessimistic--thi
s does not foreclose the use of monetary policy, 
even given some of those weaknesses.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Balles now please.   MR. BALLES.  I just wanted to make a 
brief comment, Mr. Chairman, underscoring 
Lyle™s conclusion that, all things considered, th
e risks are predominantly on the downside at the 
moment.  My comment is to the effect that I am
 seeing growing evidence of this among directors 
of our Bank.  They come from very large co
mpanies whose inventory planning is now quite 
cautious as a result of what they consider 
a sluggishness feeding on itself and who are also inclined to keep revising their capital spending plans in a downward direction or to at least defer them until they see more concrete evidence of this
 pickup that the forecasting fraternity has been 
promising.   
In short, I think this is an area that we n
eed to keep a very close eye on because these inventory plans and capital spending plans are not set in concrete.  As we all know, in the real world, they™re subject to ongoing revision and reassessment, and I th
ink that™s probably the area of greatest concern to me:  what might happe
n if we don™t get some rebound in consumer 
spending following the sluggishness of the past several months, what 
this might do to revise or at 
least stretch out what we™ve been hoping for in the way of a fairly significant rebound in capital spending and some improvement in the strength in
 inventories.  I don™t think that™s necessarily 10/19/76 - 24 - 
going to happen in view of the current skeptical attitude on the part of a lot of large concerns.  At 
least the ones that I™m familiar with.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. Guffey, may we hear from you.   
MR. GUFFEY.  Lest the impact 
of a couple of statements in 
the Redbook be lost, I™d like to observe that one of the problems we™re seeing
 develop in the central part of the country involves prices and not growth to the extent th
at [prices of] cattle and agricultural commodities 
are again at a very low level.  And as a result, this translates into retail sales at a lower, 
progressively lower phase.  We have cattle in th
e feeder area, for exampl
e, that are now losing money again on each head that™s sold.  Wheat prices, for example,
 are at a low level, and the 
growers are holding on to the wheat rather than selling it, in anticipation of a higher level 
sometime in the future, and this is putting pressure on particularly small [unintelligible].   
But I think that all translates, at least in my mind, to the eff
ect that since we have been 
through a growing season, we would not expect retail sales to pick up or make any great 
contribution in the near future because of the low prices [nor] spending for agricultural equipment or agribusiness-rela
ted capital spending.  I don™t think you™re going to see the mid 
part of the country make much of
 a contribution in this area.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. Volcker.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Th
e advantage of coming late, 
Mr. Chairman, is that the 
observations that one was going to make have al
ready been pretty well made.  Mr. Guffey™s 
comments remind me--I think it™s a fact that the 
slowdown in personal income has probably been 
more directly related to the slowdown in agricultural income than anything else in the last couple 
of months.  Is that correct?   
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes.  That certainly has been
 a factor, particularly last month, and in August also.  If you look at personal income in
 real terms, though, the slowdown goes back quite 
a ways.  The rates of growth of real personal income begin slowing about April.  We™ve had only 
a moderate rate of expansion from April on.  Pr
ior to that, personal income was going up at quite a good clip.  I think the basic reason for the slowdow
n in real personal income is traced to the 
slowdown in production.  That™s the most important factor.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 
 I was going to make some observations on the 
international situation, which we really covere
d pretty completely between Governors Wallich, 
Partee, and yourself.  Let me just 
add that I think the most critic
al country is certainly Germany, 
which was not mentioned, and, there, things seem 
to be moving a bit sluggishly.  The sense one 
has is that, if anything, they are going to tighten up a bit because they don™t like the growth in their aggregates, which poses a bit 
of a problem, particularly in te
rms of the vulnerabilities of the 
exchange rate, which I wouldn™t like to see further upset at this point--it™s just an additional complication in our own policymaking.   
In the U.K. situation, it does seem to me that
 things in the production sense will get worse 
before they get better.  It is almost inevitable in 
their situation.  I™m not so
 sure we can absorb so much more of these deficits very easily.  I™m 
just not sure it™s going to work out that way.  
10/19/76 - 25 - 
Particularly with our exchange rate being as weak as it is and with production here slowing down, it only points up the vulnerability of the international financial situation.  
With respect to the LDCs, it™s going to be ha
rd as hell for them 
to cut down on their deficits and therefore cut down on their external borrowing, which is already too high.  It™s an additional real financial and economic risk in this situation, as I see it.  So the stakes get raised all around.   One point that I would make that I don™t 
think has been commented on may be fairly 
obvious.  I think part of the more depressed mood 
that seems to be rath
er general around this table and in the economy is partly related to 
the oncoming election.  People are not terribly 
happy with the way that campaign has developed, to
 say the least.  Which raises at least the 
possibility that, whoever gets elected, people may feel a little better after November 2nd.  
Feeling that uncertainty is behind them, in the little sense that maybe some more coherent 
program or policies will be emerging.  I don™t know if
 that™s true, but I do think that part of the throes of uncertainty is fairly directly relate
d to the malaise in the 
political environment.   None of this tells me very directly what to 
do in terms of policy, and I also want to raise a 
question Mr. Eastburn made and Mr
. Gramley commented upon.  My fi
rst instinct would be that the economy needs a further push that might more
 efficiently [come] through the tax avenue.  
But that might not be a very realistic way 
of getting it, under all the circumstances, very 
promptly anyway, given political [unintelligible]. 
 We could be basically dealing with the kinds 
of structural confidence problem that are commonly found, which raises some question about 
any of the traditional knee-jerk kinds of reactions.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s very helpful,
 Mr. Volcker.  Mr. Black, please.   MR. BLACK.  I wonder if I might ask Mr. Gramley one more question?  Lyle, if you had 
known that real GNP for the third quarter was going to come in at 4 percent instead of 3.3 
percent as you assumed, would that have 
significantly affected your projections?   
MR. GRAMLEY.  No.  Particularly not give
n the source of the difference between our projected growth of real GNP and that by the Commerce Department.  The difference between 
our projected figure for real GNP growth and that put out by the Commerce Department this 
morning lies primarily in the estimate of increase 
in consumer service expenditures.  Now that 
doesn™t have any implications for th
e future at all, so we would end up with the same projections.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Which is one of the least reliable elements of the national income 
accounts.   MR. PARTEE.  Do they have a big increase?   

MR. GRAMLEY.  They have a bigger increase th
an we do.  We have a moderate increase, ours could be too small.  I just don™t know.   
MR. BLACK.  Do you know what real private final purchases look like?  Do you have that 
figure?   
10/19/76 - 26 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yeah, it™s, I remember, 
an increase of 4.4 percent in the third quarter.   MR. BLACK.  That™s faster than it was in the second, if I remember right.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t have the figures.   MR. BLACK.  It is, it was, let™s see.  Second, 4.7, so, you said 4.7.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  4.4  
MR. BLACK.  4.4.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s my recollection, 
I don™t have it here.  But it™s higher than the increase in real GNP--I believe it would come
 out 4.4.  All right, thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. MacLaury.   
MR. MACLAURY.  Just a very brief comment.
  Paul Volcker has already brought out the fact that nonagricultural income has been risi
ng in the last couple of months--I don™t know, I 
would say by a rather decent rate.  The 8.6 percent in August and 8.9 percent in September--that 

has very mixed implications for our District, as 
it does for Roger Guffey™s.  It means that the 
agricultural sector at the moment
 is, I think, bearing the brunt--and [with] the drought in our area in particular.  We see a very substantial differenc
e in retail sales in the purely agricultural areas 
of our District from the more industrialized or 
evenly spread industry of
 the Twin Cities.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You say you see a large difference?   
MR. MACLAURY.  A large difference, yes.  Re
tail sales are definitely sluggish in those centers that depend upon the agricultural sector, including, of course, sales of farm implements, 
as I think Roger mentioned.  That™s sluggish.  On 
the other hand, I™d like to give one other straw to Willis Winn™s point about retail sales.  One of
 our directors mentioned last Thursday that, in 
the first two weeks of October, one of the nati
onal retailers based in our District has seen a substantial pickup in retail sales.  Not just in our District but, I assume, in the stores around the 
nation.  His stores around the nation doesn™t add all that much. 
 And one other straw on that same side.  Capital spending by one of our larg
e computer firms based locally had been held 
back substantially.  And the member who™s on our
 board who had been pessimistic about capital 
spending up until now said that he was beginning to
 see a turn, in that the orders for computers 
were coming in rather substantially, and he was 
feeling better about that than he had up until 
now.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Any other comments on the 
economy?  Yes, please.   
MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, I don™t share the pe
ssimism that has been expressed by some, 
and I base my impressions on some very extensiv
e and real contacts that we™ve made in recent 
weeks throughout our District.  While some of you 
have traveled the distant lands, we™ve gone to such exotic places as Evansville, Indiana; Columb
ia, Missouri; Quincy, Illinoi
s.  In these tours, 
which we refer to as our Autumn Grand Tour in
 the Eighth District, we meet with bankers and 10/19/76 - 27 - 
with businessmen, usually substantial businessme
n.  I™d say that we have touched base with maybe 150 to 175 such people in the last five or 
six weeks, and we get a relatively optimistic 
reaction from these people.   Retailers in this area, oh, they are not setting records, but they look forward to expanding sales later in the year.  Our chemical firms, whic
h are substantial, large, multinational firms, are 
optimistic as they look into 1977 for maybe a 10 
percent increase in their business in the 12 months ahead.  A large manufactur
er of motors is operating at full capacity.  They™ve got a full 
backlog, and generally, the input that we get from these sources is not one to result in discouragement.  And I wonder whether our problem might be that we are tending to be 
somewhat shocked by comparing what has happened
 recently with what happened with the rate of growth and the rate of the recovery 
after the trough of th
e recent recession.   If you take, for example, GNP, and if our ec
onomists are correct, I™m told that over the 
past five years, real GNP has grown an average of maybe 2.7 percent and th
at, over the past 40 to 50 years, the average has been, and I can™t substantiate these figures, about 3-1/2 percent annual growth.  So if we™re growing at 4 or a little over 4 percent, I™m not sure that this is the time to 
pull the panic button.   I might close by just pointing out one matter--maybe it should be reserved until our next 
item on the agenda--but at the end of each of th
ese meetings, we poll these people in a similar 
way.  We give them three mythical, or general, or simplistic alternatives:  stimulating the 

economy, or greater restraint, or holding the line.
  There was not one individual who indicated a desire for economic--for monetary stimulus.  Th
e majority of them said, don™t rock the boat.  
And if there was any deviation from that, it wa
s a little bit on the side
 of greater monetary 
restraint.  And for whatever it™s worth, those ar
e real people and this is a recent--I did not mean 
that, sir, in a--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you™ve contrasted the thinking of people as over against the numbers that we™ve been concentrated on heav
ily, and I™m thinking your comments should help 
all of us in restoring perspective just a bit.  Mr. Balles.   
MR. BALLES.  I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if
 I could ask Lyle for some additional 
clarification on this statement th
at he doesn™t think the present situation lends itself--I think he 
used the word amenable.  Lyle if the present si
tuation is not amenable 
to correction by monetary policy, does that mean--  
MR. GRAMLEY.  I believe 
I said not readily.  MR. BALLES.  I was trying to find out whether you meant that an ex
tra dose of monetary 
stimulus for some period like say six months, a 
year ahead would have no good effects, or if it would be an inferior way of getting , or just what?  Because, in a nutshell, my staff did a 
simulation using our version of the FRB-MIT mode
l.  And cranking in an assumption that, for a 
year ahead, [there is] an extra 1 
percentage point growth in M1 than we have had, they did come 
up with different results.   It showed some measurable incr
ease in real GNP next year, to a growth rate of 5.9 percent for the year instead of 4.7 percent.  Showed the unemployment rate by th
e fourth quarter of 1977 10/19/76 - 28 - 
ending up lower, at 6.3 percent, than it would otherwise have been at 6.7 percent.  And with little effect in that period on the rate of inflation.  So that I would like to, perhaps this is not the point to do it, but to examine this possibility of a 
one-shot short-term action in the way of extra monetary stimulus that could be withdrawn so that we don™t get ongoing inflationary effects from having done something to try to pick up 
the rate of capital spending and housing and whatever.  In other words, I™m not inclined to yo
ur conclusion, if it was in fact a conclusion, that we can™t do anything meaningful.  I guess I™m now 
back to the question that I asked you when you clarified just what you had in mind.   
MR. GRAMLEY.  I™ll be happy to try.  I certainly
 would not wish to argue that additional monetary stimulus now would have no effect at all.  I do think it would have some effect.  I think it would have an effect that is small relative to 
what would have been produced by an equivalent amount of monetary stimulus in earlier postwar cy
cles at this same stage of the expansion.  I 
think it is, at this juncture, an inferior way of trying to get stimulus.  I, too, had some simulation 
runs done on the model to assess what the model ha
s to say about this problem.  The runs that I 
looked at seemed to me, as I woul
d interpret them, to be less optimistic in terms of the amount of 
stimulus to real activity.  What
 they said, in effect, was that, four quarters down the road, an additional 1 percentage point growth of M1 would give you about 0.6 percentage point in real GNP.   
The point of my argument, however, is that th
e model is based on average conditions in the past; that I do not think the conditions prevailing at the present time are like those in the past; 
and that therefore you™re just not going to get that much monetary
 stimulus.  Now if you say very 
well, but what harm is there from adding more 
money now--if it doesn™t do any good, it just lies 
around idle.  The point I would make
 is that if you can take that money out later on, then you™ve 
got no problems, but I think the experience is 
that once that additional money gets into the 
system, it™s very difficult to retract later.  
So I do think you add to your potential problems of 
inflation later on.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I not only want to th
ank you, I want to say Amen.  Any other 
comment on the state of the economy?
  Oh yes, Mr. Gardner.   MR. GARDNER.  I was interested in Governor 
Lilly™s work.  I briefly discussed it with 
Governor Lilly and Governor Partee.  I felt at that time that I couldn™t see a revival of great 
strength based on any factors that I knew might be present. 
 I™ve been worried about that conclusion all through this meeting, a
nd I must admit I think I™ve been 
helped.  It is also true that when you study the possibilities for significant decline, you have to look, in my judgment, at 
what conditions might tend to resi
st that decline.  Employment 
is still high, unemployment is 
high, true, but wage increases are not what we feared.  Personal income isn™t growing as rapidly 
as it had earlier.  Inventories are not excessive ex
cept in terms of sales, nowhere near what they 
were at the time of that plunge
 in the sharp recession.  There has been no huge expansion of bank credit.  In fact there hasn™t been any expansion of bank credit at all.  We™ve worried about capital 
shortage crowding out.   What I™m trying to suggest is that, while we
 may find great discomfort in the situation 
we™re in today--we™re questioning some of the strength
 of the recovery at this point--I think if we applied our minds to the reverse scenario, we™d
 have some difficulty determining that the 
10/19/76 - 29 - 
economy™s ripe for a sharp decline.  I™ve been ho
ping that this country would get back on stable 
growth patterns, away from some of our discomfo
rts in the last few years.  We may be unwilling 
to accept these stable growth patterns when they 
have all the characteristics that we™ve been 
discussing today.   All I™m suggesting is that we 
have been attracted to the idea that everybody may be wrong, 
that recovery may be petering out.  I™m not so sure
.  I also think downside risk always exists, but the downside risk in my judgment at this point
 in the economy isn™t the kind of downside risk 
that inspires a fearful scenario of a sharp drop 
all the way around.  The conditions don™t seem to 
be here anymore.  I don™t know what that means for our deliberations but--  
MR. PARTEE.  When you say downside risks, 
you mean risks of absolute decline?   
MR. GARDNER.  Yeah.  There may be a risk of 
decline to some extent
 but not precipitous declines.  Agricultural, I™ve heard about agricultural income, but I am also well aware that a lot 
of people consume, Roger, when agricultural pri
ces are lower.  [Unintelligible], and that of course ameliorates infl
ationary pressure.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner, any other comment on the economy?  
Yes, Mr. Jackson.   MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I think St
eve™s comment makes me want to say 
something.  We have been through a long period of 
declines in unemployment rates.  Declines in 
inflation rates.  Coupled with what in ma
ny people™s judgment in our society and around the world has been relatively conservative monetary po
licy.  And I think that th
e issue that Governor Gardner just mentioned is not that we™re going 
to suffer absolute decline.  I personally don™t think that™s a likely prospect.   I think the issue facing us is whether the rate of progress in the future 
will continue to be acceptable in our society and other societies--so 
that, while the concept of the ultimate solution 
being achieved through further control of inflation and further conservative monetary concepts 
will continue to be bought, I think the test will co
me as to whether or not our rate of progress 
becomes acceptable in our society, not whether we have
 an absolute decline.  And to that extent, 
it may be even more difficult to continue to hold 
the world™s feet to the fire, if I can put it that 
way, even though we may be convinced of the or
iginal wisdom of the concept, [and the] objective, and the approach to reach that objective.
  As I say, it may be much more difficult in 
the future.   
Now, that brings up the question as to whether or not a temporary bow in the other 
direction might produce significant ch
ange as we continue to pursue the objective in the way that 
we™ve been going or, indeed, the way the world™s going.  But it strikes me as [being] relative rates of progress that we™re talki
ng about, and I don™t share quite the pessimism in the tone that I 
hear around the table.  I see a slowdown, but I don™t see quite as pessimistic a rate of slowdown 
as other people have seen in general.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Jackson.  Any other comment on 
the economy?  Well, I just want to add one word. 
 I™m disappointed, in the sense that I expected 
more progress on the unemployment front by now th
an has occurred.  I feel increasingly that 
10/19/76 - 30 - 
what I had to say in a paper that I presented some two years ago about a long economic wave 
which ended in a speculative phase--speculation fi
rst in the acquisition of business firms, the 
great merger [and] conglomerate movement; 
and then speculation in stock exchanges; speculation in real estate; and then speculation in i
nventories--that led to a severe recession in the economy.  Where I feel that I probably made a mist
ake in economic analysis is in feeling perhaps 
more optimistic about the rate of recovery than 
I, for one, should have.  It™s a point I™ve made 
here before.  I don™t believe I made it in th
at paper.  I haven™t gone back to it.   Wishful thinking about the econom
y, unfortunately, is to some degree unavoidable; it™s a hard thing to control.  The thought that has dominated my ow
n thinking during the past six months is that we have a new generation of businessmen, a new generation of bankers.  They™ve 
gone through a severe recession.  They were unprepared for it psychologically.  Nothing that they learned at the university prepared them for it.
  Nothing that they read
 in their newspapers or 
magazines prepared them for it.  And as a resu
lt, businessmen, bankers, have become cautious.   
Now gradually, I think, confidence has been returning, though I must say that I share some 
of the feeling that Mr. Partee expressed with regard to the stock market.  That seems to argue to 
the contrary.  But in spite of that, I have the impression that, within the business community, 
confidence is gradually returning.  But we should have expected a gradual return, whereas we didn™t.  Or at least I didn™t.  I thought the return of confidence would be speedier.  And from the 
viewpoint of policy, the critical 
question is, what can best be done to strengthen the state of confidence.  And for a country like Great Britain, I think the answer is pretty clear that drastic changes in economic policy are necessary.  A se
vere cutback in expenditure, which could be accompanied by some easing of monetary policy a
nd a stop to nationalization threats, etc.   
In the case of our own economy, I doubt--this 
is a point on which I disagree with Lyle--I doubt that a more liberal fiscal policy would help matters.  I do think that if we had a cut in taxes 
accompanied by a cut in expenditures, and if the cut 
in taxes were concentrated in large part in a 
reduction of business taxes, I do think that such a change in the structure of our fiscal budget would help to restore confidence--would work in 
our direction.  Apart from that, a great number 
of structural changes in the economy with regard to the functioni
ng of our labor markets, with 
regard to our environmental programs, etcetera, I 
think would be helpful.  Now I think monetary 
policy can also be of some assistance to [conditio
ns] like this as at any other time.  But I would 
agree with Lyle™s analysis that a given injecti
on of monetary ease would have less effect in the 
current environment than it had in ea
rlier business cycle expansions.   Well, I think we ought to turn now to our next subject.  And let me say a word about how I 
think we can best conduct our meeting from th
is point on.  As I believe members of the 
Committee have been informed, we will have to 
testify before the Senate Banking [Committee] 
on November 11 on our monetary policy.  And that 
means that some 23 days will elapse between 
today and the date of the testimony.  That is a 
much longer interval than the lapse between our 
decision on longer-range annual targets and the disclosure of those targets to one or the other of the banking committees.   
In view of that, I think it would be inadvisable to try to reach a decision on longer-range targets today.  I think we could usefully have
 a preliminary discussi
on, but that should be followed up, and probably by a telephone conference meeting which could best be scheduled 
10/19/76 - 31 - 
[unintelligible] on November 8.  And the reason for my choice of Nove
mber 8 is that I have to be in Dallas on November 4 and will not be back unt
il November 5, which is a Friday.  I™d like to 
spend the weekend reviewing any fresh evidence 
that has come in, and therefore November 8, which is a Monday, will still give us enough time 
to reach a final decision and still prepare the testimony that has to be presented.   
So I think what we ought to do today is discu
ss first of all the short-range targets for the two-month interval, as we do every month, and th
en turn to a discussion of the longer-range targets.  Now before we turn to that, we just have enough time before we break for luncheon, we 
might have Mr. Axilrod™s report on wh
at the Bluebook has to teach us.   
MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This statem
ent was not found in Committee records.]   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, are there any questions or comments?   
MR. PARTEE.  I didn™t hear you quantify the substitution question of Ml for time-type 
deposits.  Is it pretty substantial, conceivably?   
MR. AXILROD.  Well, we had worked out various
 estimates of this or our best estimates 
of it.  We had over the past year been working it
 out in detail, from the basis of the year ending 
in the third quarter of ™76.  We 
thought that something less than half--will be about 40 percent or so--of the rate of growth of Ml would represent the extent to which Ml growth had been dampened.  This makes the allowance I have me
ntioned for business savings deposits.  We ran 
this survey within the last week
 or so, asking the banks for the activity, the extent to which these 
savings accounts are used in transactions--these are overlapping questions--and the extent to which they are used as 
compensating balances.   
And our judgment, from the results of this, we
re that about a quarter of the net inflows 
since February or March were a direct substitute for demand deposits.  The allowance we had 
made earlier had really reduced that to virtually 
negligible proportions, th
at is, we had earlier assumed that the increase in business savings depos
its was roughly at the same
 rate of increase as the increase in Ml, so that we weren™t getting any real diversion out of Ml type deposits, you weren™t getting a real bias in your estimate.   
MR. PARTEE.  Having the initial move.   

MR. AXILROD.  Right.  After the initial adjustment, which has gone on for several 
months--we assumed that by now this was endi
ng.  So I can™t give you the exact numbers, 
Governor Partee, because we haven™t worked it out 
in as much detail as we did very recently, but 
we-- MR. PARTEE.  You are supporting some of th
e increase for M1--do you mean by that an 
adjusted Ml--  MR. AXILROD.  To be specific--  
MR. PARTEE.  6-1/2 instead of 4-1/2?   
10/19/76 - 32 - 
MR. AXILROD.  M1 grew at close to a 4-1/2 percent rate of growth from the third quarter 
of ™75 to the third [quarter] of ™76.  Our estimat
e of the substitutes would 
add--well, it varies on 
how you like to do it--but I™d say between 1-1/2 and 2 percentage points to that.  So now, so you would be between 6 and 6-1/2 percent, someth
ing like that, and with the most important 
[substitute] being business savings deposits in that 
period.  But also there are a number of others.  
And I™m sure that™s more than we had allowe
d before, particularly in the business--   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, Mr. Axilrod has been unduly modest.  I think that the little study you made for me should be expanded and, in
 due course, perhaps by our next meeting, 
distributed to the Committee.  Now that little study shows the following, and the methodology is 
not described here, and there is inevitably a considerable element of hazardous estimation.  But 
the results come out as follows:  in the third qua
rter of ™75 and the third quarter of ™76, the growth rate of M1 is 4.4 percent.  Changes in financial technology reduced this growth rate of M1 an estimated 1.9 percentage points, which mean
s that in the absence of changes in financial technology, the growth of M1 would have been 6.3 percent.  Also, Mr. Axilrod reports that in making these estimates we have attempted to be qu
ite conservative, which means that, if there is 
known bias in the estimation, it is
 in the direction of understating the effects of changes in financial technology.   MR. PARTEE.  If there were changes in financial technology also earlier, I would have the adjustments--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, but earlier I have no calculations on that.  But taking the individual factors accounting for the 1.9, we know that these are very recent developments in the 
largest part.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What are the elements of these based upon?   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you have the NOW accounts, you have state and local 
government accounts, you have NOW demand deposits
 at mutual savings banks in New York, I 
don™t know how widespread that is, credit unions, money market mutual funds, telephonic 
transfers--well, that would be 
business savings accounts.  A rather large number of dramatic 
changes of financial technology concentrated within the past year, or year and a half, or a number of them go back f
our or five years.   MR. PARTEE.  State and local savings deposits have ballooned in recent months--didn™t I 
read that in the Greenbook or someplace?   
MR. AXILROD.  That™s right, but we allowed very little effect--direct effect--on the 
demand deposits.   
MR. PARTEE.  I think it mainly would have co
me out of open market instruments.   
MR. AXILROD.  To give you a rough idea, these are preliminary estimates, judgmental, 
really, of the $2.6 billion increase in state and local savings accounts over the year ending the third quarter of ™76.  We assume that only 
$600 million represented substitutes for demand deposits, basing that more on the experience of wh
at happened earlier when there [unintelligible] 
interest rates effect.  So we assumed virtually most of it was in in
terest rate effect, and we used 10/19/76 - 33 - 
this lower number.  Whereas for NOW accounts, we 
assumed almost all of the increase, not quite 
all but almost all, say 70 percen
t, was the substitute.  That was the sort of judgment we had.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Ther
e™s another factor here that seems to be moving in 
the same direction, suggesting th
e effective increase in money supply has been bigger than it 
looks naked.  I can™t believe myself it hasn™t ha
d some impact.  The outstanding characteristic of 
this advance [unintelligible], so far is the banking world is concerned, is the lack of loan 
demands.  And when you look at this whole [unintel
ligible] of expansion, I can™t believe that this has not significantly reduced the increase in compensating balances for loan demand to what is 
typical in earlier [unintelligible] deposits meas
ured, but it seems to me it must have had some 
significant effect.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There was some rough allowance made for th
at in this calculation.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In
 that figure that you--  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s within th
at figure, a small component.   
MR. AXILROD.  We made an allowance of a
bout $1 billion which, after much back-and-
forth argument, really came out to be on the low 
side.  And it™s somewhat consistent with the 
evidence of what™s happening to business shares in the demand deposits survey.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don™t know how you measure 
it, but I just can™t believe this.  The expansion is [unintelligible
] component, it™s from our advance--  
MR. PARTEE.  In addition, we get some indi
cation from these surv
eys that they were limiting it on compensating balances, so that 
even under [unintelligible] you might have some 
insufficient incomes on the balance.   
MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, we shouldn™t forg
et, on the other side, that CDs, which in corporations, after all, are highly monetary, were going down all al
ong, so if the higher ends of 4 and 5 have a negative bias from that source, I 
don™t know what to say about Treasury bills, which presumably have a very similar role 
[unintelligible] probably expanding.   MR. PARTEE.  May I answer that?   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that if this
 does nothing else [unintelligible] our staff, 
it helps to remind us that if 
you talk about the money supply, you
™re not talking about a unique [concept].  Mr. Morris.   MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, for a number 
of months now, this Committee has been instructing the Manager to give equal weight to M1 and M2.  And I think the continuing diversion [of] growth rates is a continuation of relative growth rates which are out of line with our past history.  It seems to me that is going 
to give the Manager problems in continuing this 
kind of directive.  I was wondering what a
dvice Mr. Axilrod would have for the Committee on 
how we ought to proceed in the future [unintelligible].   10/19/76 - 34 - 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, President Morris, in the in
terest of time I cut out a last paragraph 
which went into that, not in any detail, really, but [unintelligible] I think implicit in the last 
paragraph that I did read.  I would argue, I believe, that if growth rates in
 M2, for example, turn out to be lower over the next few weeks than were projected, that this probably should be 
discounted for two reasons: first, they have been very high recently, and [second] particularly [so] if it turns out this is o
ccurring because of lagged adjustment by banks to the decline in market rates, so that they are simply becomi
ng less aggressive in seeking out depositors and permitting those funds to move into market instru
ments rather than grabbing them for their own 
deposits.  That sort of realignment of rate leve
ls, with the transaction drop in the rate of 
inflows--if that were to occur, I would suggest you would not want to give half weight to M2 under those particular circumstances.   
On the other hand, if M1 were growing very slowly, and there was collateral evidence that the economy was also growing much slower than expected, then it seems to me, because I 

believe M1 is more reflective of transactions
 [than] M2 under those circumstances, you might 
want to give somewhat more weight to M1.   
So I would say that the key thing is not a m
echanical rule of half and half, although that would certainly be a satisfactory starting point, but an analysis of the collateral developments in 
the economy that are occurring in financial market
s while you™re observing what is happening to M1 and M2, and that [analysis] would guide me.  
So it™s an argument agai
nst strictly adhering to a rule, although I would start off with a half-and-half rule and modify
 [in] the directions that I™ve mentioned.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The inference I draw from your comments is that, first, we™ve 
been wise in instructing the Desk to give approximately equal weight to 
M1 and M2 rather than to give identical weights to the two.  [We] expressed the approximate part.  Now the second 
inference that I would draw is that this is not a matter that the Committee can properly deal with.  
A fairly liberal interpretation of the adverb ﬁapproximatelyﬂ should be
 left to the staff, to take account of the sort of considerations and to just mention--that would be my inference, and isn™t 
that approximately or roughly 
what you have been doing?   
SPEAKER(?).  I think so, Mr. Chairman, yes.   

[MR. BALLES.]  Mr. Chairman, even on that 
basis, by definition if you go 50-50 in a very strict arithmetic sense, you™re really, based on the present quantities involved [unintelligible,] 
have 72 percent in demand deposits and currenc
y, and balancing the other components if we 
have to [unintelligible].  SPEAKER(?).  John™s right, it™s because Ml is
 the major component of [unintelligible]. 
SPEAKER(?).  I™m not that smart and 
just figure the [unintelligible].  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That is right, Ml is counted twice--by itself and second as a component of M2.   
MR. PARTEE.  That helps to the degree of substitution--then we get the offsets of substitution.   10/19/76 - 35 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, gentlemen, I wonder if this isn™
t as good as time as any--Mr. 
Black and Mr. Wallich still have questions
 they want to put to Mr. Axilrod.   
MR. BLACK.  I can make mine very brief, 
Mr. Chairman.  I just want to commend the 
staff on this analysis with the 1.9 percent because I have been feeling for some time the M2 
balances were assuming a lot of the [role] of tran
saction balances.  I just want to point out that there would be a tendency on the part of this group to assume that you had also reduced the rate 
of growth in M2 by 1.9 percent, but it™s over twice as large as M1.  So the reduction in that rate would be maybe 7/10 of a percentage point, or something like that.   
MR. PARTEE.  [Unintelligible.]  

MR. AXILROD.  M2 would not be affecte
d, President Black, because we™re assuming 
these are demand deposits that go into savings depos
its, not other market instruments that go into 
savings deposits.   MR. BLACK.  Yeah, I guess that would be right--  
SPEAKER(?).  Only to the extent 
that other thrift institutions--  MR. BLACK.  Well, I shouldn™t have made 
even that brief remark, but I do commend 
them on that.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, gentlemen, [unint
elligible] this specific moment.  Let us 
break for lunch and return at 2:30.   [Lunch recess] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  In the inte
rest of brevity, I want to make some suggestions to the 
Committee with regard to the short-run ranges an
d with regard to the longer-run ranges.  And then I think we ought to have a discussion of where we want to go in the short run, that is, with regard to our two-month ranges.
  And after that to a discussion of tentative preliminary 
discussion of our targets for the coming year.   
Now turning first to the short-run ranges, I feel, without stopping to elucidate, that a slight easing move at the present time would be appropr
iate.  I don™t think that you would be taking a great risk.  I think the movement
 should be very small.  I can™t find my notes, but I think I know 
what I want to say.  I would suggest that the range for the federal funds rate during the months of 
October and November be 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  Whic
h means that we would move down.  We would 
lower the lower limit by 1/4
 percent, and likewise the upper lim
it, from where it was during the 
preceding months.  I would raise M1 somewhat as
 specified under alternative B--5 to 9, I 
believe; M2, 9 to 13.  In other words, I™m r
ecommending the specificatio
ns of alternative B with slight modifications.   
SPEAKER(?).  Did you say M1 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 under B,
 or 5 to 9?   
10/19/76 - 36 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™m looking at alternative B, which I™m accepting 
fundamentally.  But M1 I would make 5 to 9; M2
 I™d leave as is; federal funds rate 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.   MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, would that co
ntemplate an immediate movement of the 
funds rate?  Are you contemplating an immediate 
move of the funds rate to say, 4-7/8, which 
would be the midpoint?   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the midpoint, I ha
ve an open mind on that.  We could move to the midpoint in the near future and have a sy
mmetrical range or we co
uld retain the kind of asymmetry that we had last month.  In other word
s, we have a 1/2 percentage point at the lower-end range and 1/4 percentage point at the upper end; we have the kind of asymmetry we had last month.  But--   MR. PARTEE.  Four to five, Mr. Chairman, I th
ink that™s a question of 4-3/4.  What would 
be your starting point?   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  On the symmetrical, if
 you move symmetrically, then the midpoint 
would be 4-7/8, which means that we would get ther
e in about a week, and then move to the left 
or to the right depending on the behavior of incoming data on the monetary aggregates.  A 
second possibility is to retain 
precisely the kind of asymmetry that the Committee agreed to last 
month:  The federal funds rate would remain 
at 5 percent, for the time being, and then, 
depending on incoming data, would move 
toward 4-1/2 or toward 5-1/4.   MR. PARTEE.  I guess my thought was, and I think maybe Frank thought, too, that really 
the funds rate ought to 4-3/4 now and--   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It ought to be what?   
MR. PARTEE.  It ought to be 4-3/4.  We haven™
t used the full range available to us as specified by the Committee at the last meeting. 
 I wasn™t there.  The aggregates would [unintelligible] being pretty large, pretty well down toward that.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have been away and I have not studied the incoming evidence, 
but I was under the impression that the Desk 
has operated strictly in accordance with the 
instructions of the Committee, a
nd ending the month at a 5 percentage point was precisely where the Desk should have been, in view of the joint behavior of M1 and M2.  I suspect that you™re thinking mainly of M1, but I don™t have these--I 
have not studied the figures as closely as I customarily do.  Now, Peter, defend your own re
cord or demolish it as you see fit.   
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I believe that we were right in following Committee instructions to 
come out where we did, at 5 percent.  I think 
we did gradually weaken as we had the evidence, midway through the period, of weakness in Ml part
ly offset by reasonable strength in M2.  The latest week of evidence that we
 had showed Ml still weak, but slightly less weak, and M2 
picking up a little bit.  I think if we had had the last week™s numbers earlier on, I™m not sure there 
would have been as strong a case for going down even to 5 percent.  But having gotten there, I don™t think it was so different as to call for a reversal.   10/19/76 - 37 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  As I look at these figures, they seem to confirm what I said rather 
than what you said, Mr. Partee.  Giving equal weight to Ml and M2.   MR. PARTEE.  I guess you™re right.  M2 crept up on me, without my realizing it.  You 
were below, even on exactly equal we
ighing.  It™s below the midpoint--   
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Below the midpoint, but still within a zone of indifference as we--   MR. PARTEE.  --below the lower point on 
Ml, and have been throughout. Perhaps I shouldn™t have, but I was trying to join Frank in [
unintelligible].  I™m inclined to think that I 
would prefer to see markets easing, and prefer to
 see them easing a little more than specified 
[unintelligible].  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The sum of the midpoint
s as specified would have been 16.  The actual came out 14.7.  The sum of the lower limits 
was 12.  And therefore I™d say that on a very literal reading, the federal funds rate should have been a little above 5 percent.  I don™t think anyone would want to read it that literally, and the kind of arithmetic I™ve just done, I™ve done 
for the first time [as a] check on your observation. 
 I trust my eye more than I do this kind of 
arithmetic.  Well, that shouldn™t detain us. 
 I™ve made my suggestion, and members of the 
Committee will deal with it as they see fit.   
Let me make a suggestion about the longer-run 
ranges.  There, I would suggest that we leave the ranges for M2 and M3 where they are but that we modify the range for M1.  At present 

the range is 4-1/2 to 7.  And my suggestion to the Committee w
ould be that we lower the upper limit of Ml to 6-1/2.  In other words, a range of 
4-1/2 to 6-1/2 instead of 4-1/2 to 7.  Now, my 
reason for making this proposal is that I think it important that we continue making progress 
toward achieving monetary growth rates that are 
more nearly consistent with price stability.  
We™ve moved very gradually in th
at direction during the past year, year and a half.  I would emphasize that our moves have been extremely gra
dual.  If we continued the pace at which we have traveled thus far, it would take us perhaps 8 or 10 years to achieve monetary aggregates that 
are roughly consistent with general 
price stability in so far as we can now estimate it or as far as I 
can now estimate it.  So I don™t thin
k I™m making a radical proposal.   
Now, the criticism that might be leveled agai
nst us--that this points to a more restrictive 
monetary policy--that criticism w
ould not be well founded.  As things have turned out during the 
past year, year and a half--it wasn™t a deliberate movement on our pa
rt, but as things have turned out--Ml has been at approximately the lower li
mit of our growth range--approximately at 5 
percent.  During the 12 months, it™s been below that, a little below 5 percent.  Therefore, while the target range is lowered, th
ere would be ample opportunity for this Committee to increase the 
growth rate up to 6-1/2 percent, which is well
 beyond the zone that we™ve reached during any 12-
month period.  And, of course, at
 any subsequent meeting, we coul
d readjust the growth rate.   What I™m saying in effect is that we™ve had 
a range for Ml that we haven™t used.  And cutting back a little at the upper end would be realistic, and it would be another symbolic move 
or demonstration on our part that 
we seek to return this nation™s monetary growth to a level that 
eventually will be once again in harmony with, and not
 inconsistent with, general price stability.   
10/19/76 - 38 - 
Well, these are my suggestions to the Committ
ee, and I believe it would make for a more 
orderly discussion if we talk first about the next month and what our target ranges should be for October-November, and then turn to a preliminary 
discussion of the one-year targets.  I don™t see any hand up.  Mr. Volcker, why don™t you start.  Mr. Mayo will follow.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  Well, I basically am in fu
ll agreement with the kind of 
philosophy that you expressed for both the short and long run.  And I come up with the same 
federal funds range that you specified.  I thought this worked out rather well last time in terms of 
sneaking in a little easing 
but not doing it very abruptly.  I still think it is premature right now, 
given not only our economic conditions but also th
is time on the calendar, to give a really strong 
signal of easing, but I think it™s appropriate to go in that direction.  So, within that general specification, I would have some preference for th
e kind of asymmetrical treatment that we gave 
it last month, but that™s perhaps marginal.   
I do think the ranges that you have specified [for the monetary a
ggregates] just strike me as being a bit on the high side.  I worry about that M2 range, for instance, which is not quite, but almost, entirely above the long-term range--a13 pe
rcent figures in the shop window, so to speak, worries me a bit.  So I would be inclined 
to, say, knock 1/2 percentage point off of those numbers, so it would be 4-1/2 to
 8-1/2 [for M1] and either 8 to 12 or 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 [for M2], 
but these are pretty small differences.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have 
no quarrel with that.  I was influenced really by the 
estimates that your Bank is making, and they™re 
above the estimates of the Board™s staff.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Only slightly 
on the M2, they are significantly above it on the M1.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s why I raised [M1 to] 5 to 9.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That worries me a bit, but I suppose I am most 
impressed when you talk about these ranges, a
nd Mr. Axilrod™s very trenchant comments in 
general.  The most trenchant one of all seems to me the clause that he began with, and that you 
can begin almost every one of these meetings w
ith:  ﬁContrary to the staff expectations...ﬂ   MR. AXILROD.  I don™t think I said that.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  ﬁ–Ml
 and M2 did thus and so.ﬂ  In fact, I think you can make the case for widening this range, so this 
is the ground that we™ve gone through before.  If you had said 4 to 9, I™d be happy.  But I™m just wo
rried about those ranges being a little on the high side given all-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Ml
 as well as M2?  
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes, I™m worri
ed about the M2 figure being too high when you say 13.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What would you do?  Where would you lower them?   
10/19/76 - 39 - 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, now, I™m just thinking in my mind, but if I really 
had my druthers, I™d say, I guess, 4-1/2 to 9 [for M1] and 8 to 12 for M2.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you very much.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™m more concerned about the federal funds 
specifications.  I think that does reflect the ki
nd of approach that I™d like to see here.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Mr. Mayo, would you carry the discussion forward, concentrating, as we are at this 
stage, on the two-month range.   MR. MAYO.  I also had written down, before you spoke, the same federal funds 
range--4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  I share Paul Volcker™s comments on how this worked out last time, and I 
think it worked out very well.  I would be willing to try it again on mu
ch the same sort of 
approach that was taken by the Desk during the last month.   
Maybe it™s just a quibble, but I share some of the same problems that Paul has with the 5 to 
9 [for M1].  I would prefer 4-1/2 to 8-1/2.  I think I would rather see Ml go a little bit lower than the 5 percent--although this is te
rribly minor--before, in effect, we worry about our limits on 
federal funds.  I feel less strongly on the 9 to 13 [for M2]--8-1/2 to 12-1/2 is fine with me.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Coldwell now please.   MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, your formulati
on of the figures is precisely what I had written down before I came in this room th
is afternoon, so I am merely supporting what you 
said--5 to 9, 9 to 13, and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  And on the Ms, I really don™t care anymore.  These 
things are violent--fluctuating so violently it™s almost impossible to
 play with them.  I™d rather 
focus on the interest rate itself, and I™d like to keep that between 4-3/4 and 5.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell.  Mr. Eastburn next.   MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, I would agree 
with your specifications.  I have some 
preference on the funds rate to having a range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, but I think your specifications are acceptable.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Partee.   MR. PARTEE.  Well, I find myself at vari
ance with you this time, Mr. Chairman.  I 
certainly can accept the specifications you suggested
 for the aggregates--5 to 9 and 9 to 13.  I 
wouldn™t cut M2, I don™t think.  I think M2 is very hard to specify at a time when interest rates 
are dropping, and there could be continued large reintermediation of
 funds from markets into the 
banks, or [into] S&Ls in the case of M3.  And so, although the 13 [for M2] would be a high figure if we had it over a sustained period, I don™t see any problem with it as a shorter-term 
matter.  And on Ml, 5 to 9 seems to me quite 
appropriate, following a month in which we had 
[unintelligible], which we ought to give some weight to even though it™s not in the average of the 
two months that we™re looking at.   
10/19/76 - 40 - 
Now, I think that there is enough weakness in the economic situation that I 
would--assuming that the aggregates don™t give us
 surprises within the next couple of weeks, coming in very low or very high--I would like 
to see us move down somewhat more in the 
money market.  And I think the way to do that wo
uld be to specify a range [for the federal funds rate] of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, with a midpoint 4-3/4.  So
 that, unless we get some
 strengthening in the aggregates from the current expectations--I didn™t know that the New York Fed already had it, 

and perhaps they™ll be shown to be correct there--but unless we get that, it would imply a further 
gradual moving down in the objectives of the Des
k, from the roughly 5 or slightly below what it 
has been quite recently, to about 4-3/4 over the course of week or 10 days, assuming that the 
aggregates don™t come in strongly.  So I feel that 
I would prefer that 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 specification.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee. Mr. Kimbrel now please.   
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, reluctantly, I gu
ess, I™m prepared to accept some small 
monetary ease.  I think I share the expression of Mr. Gramley this
 morning that I honestly do not 
believe that monetary policy action at this point 
is going to accomplish really what we would like 
to see.  From our vantage point, I have not recognized lack of liquidity as a major reason that 
lenders are still being reluctant partners.  I would obviously prefer to see some temporary fiscal 
stimulus, but I don™t see that forthcoming, so the ne
xt alternative, I guess, is to accept almost 
exactly--or exactly--the specifications you suggested.  I think that™s about as good as we can accomplish at the moment.     
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimb
rel.  Mr. MacLaury now, please. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 I think I™m a little closer on the 
aggregates to Paul Volcker.  As I recall, I™d take
 the 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 [for M1].  I think especially--I 
know this anticipates out next discussion on the long-run aggregates--but if we do move down 
the longer-term Ml, then it would be
 in my view a little inconsiste
nt to be moving up in the short range, despite Chuck™s point about shortfalls just seen with our short-term ranges for M1.  So I™d like 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, and 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 for M2.  I like your range [for the federal funds rate] of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, but I would move within th
e first week to 4-7/8 as the midpoint.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Black please.   MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I would favor
 Mr. Volcker™s second version, which I understand to be 4-1/2 to 8 percent on Ml, 8 to 12 on M2, and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 on the federal funds rate.  But I would take the second alternative you posed as our operating procedure and hold the funds rate around 5 percent unless the aggregates come in weaker
 than projected for the next couple of months.  My guess is that the staff is right on this.  Our own staff has made similar 
projections, and I believe they™ll be coming in rather strong, a
nd I would not start moving that 
federal funds rate down until I saw evidence to the contrary.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Balles please.   MR. BALLES.  In the interest of brevity, 
Mr. Chairman, and because I am concerned 
about the uncertainties in the economy and the 
sluggishness that we™re witnessing, and until that 
gets resolved, I would resolve our policy or any uncertainties somewhat on the side of a little 
greater ease.  And I think Governor Partee has already given my speech.  I would come out with 10/19/76 - 41 - 
that same set of specifications he was talki
ng about, which was your numbers on Ml and M2.  But I would associate myself with his views on 
4-1/4 to 5-1/4 range on the federal funds rate, with the aim of nudging it down in the near future--try to give a little stimulus to 
the economy if 
only in a psychological and confidence sense.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. Morris please.   MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I find myself in
 disagreement with Mr. Gramley™s position.  
It seems to me that the basic problem of economi
c policy in the past decade is that we™ve had a 
fiscal-monetary policy mix which has been adverse to
 investment.  I think to the extent that the 
recent weakness in the economy is a product at least in part of the shortfall in government 

spending, it™s particularly appropriate that we have a response in monetary policy.  And I think 
that Mr. Gramley™s feeling that we will not ge
t much of a response in the economy to lower 
interest rates and higher security values that a somewhat easier 
policy would create, I think it™s something I don™t share.  So for all these 
reasons, I would support Mr. Partee™s position, accepting your specifications for the aggregates bu
t proposing a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 funds range with 
instruction to the Manager to move to 4-3/4 
and see how things develop from there.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Wallich now please.   

MR. WALLICH.  I share the view
 of those who argued like Governor Partee.  I see a need for some kind of a push, however mild and slow it
 would be in working.  I think we™ve been low on the aggregates over a long period of time.  I think that™s by
 and large the result of our emphasis on the funds rate.  [If] we don™t allow 
the funds rate to go down, then the aggregates will not expand, and I think that™s what™s happened
 and what seems to tell
 us that there isn™t 
much expansionary force in the banking system. 
 Well, the differences are very minor, but I™d go 
for 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 [for the federal funds rate], and the aggregates 5 to 9 and 9 to 13.  And unless there™s clear strength in the aggregates in the next week, I would move to the midpoint of that 
funds range, 4-3/4.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Lilly please.   
MR. LILLY.  I have no quarrel with Ml and M2 of 5 to 9 and 9 to 13.  I do feel that a little more ease is indicated than would come with a midpoint of 4-7/8, so 
I™d favor the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Lilly.  Who™s next?  Yes, Mr. Jackson.   MR. JACKSON.  I™d agree to the two aggregates
 constraints.  I would personally consider a kind of skewed federal funds rate of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, but to go to the ﬁmidpointﬂ of 4-3/4.  I 
wouldn™t want to see it go under 4-1/2 or over 5-1/4, but I would like to see us go to 4-3/4 right away.   MR. PARTEE.  So you™re skewing the opposite way of last time.   

MR. JACKSON.  Yes, that™s what I™d 
like to suggest.  [Unintelligible.]  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Who would like to speak next?  Mr. 
Baughman.   
10/19/76 - 42 - 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I would simply
 say that I concur with Mr. Partee™s recommendations, which use your numbers and sli
ghtly lower fed funds midpoint.  It seems to 
me that the market situation is one which just
ifies additional pressure on that prime rate and 
possibly even on the savings and small CDs.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Who is next?  I™m going to 
have to start calling on individuals.  Mr. Guffey, we haven™t heard from you.  Mr. Guffey and 
then Mr. Winn.   
MR. GUFFEY.  I don™t think I have a great deal to add Mr. Chairman.  I would hate to see 
the fed funds rate down at 4-3/4, although the specifications of 4-7/8 would be acceptable.  I think we have some other tools of monetary policy 
that I™d like to see us 
use if we were perhaps not so close to November 2.  The Desk is only on
e of three, I think, tools that we have and I prefer to see the reserve requirements and/or the discount rate us
ed at this time to get some 
psychological [unintelligible] in our economy.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. Winn.   
MR. WINN.  I think I can live with the range
 that we specified here among the group.  I 
think my preference would be for the 4-1/4 to 5-1/
4 short-term range [for the federal funds rate].  
I am more nervous about your long-ter
m suggestion, however, Mr. Chairman.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we™re going to come to that later.  Mr. Roos.   
MR. ROOS.  I would prefer the 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for Ml, 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 on M2, and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 on the federal funds rate.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Has everyone spoken?  Oh yes, Mr. Gardner.   
MR. GARDNER.  Mr. Chairman, I see a signifi
cant consensus here.  I think we™re only arguing about various minor aspects.  I think 5 to 9 [for M1], 9 to 13 [for M2], and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 [for the federal funds rate] would be appropriate.  You talk about 4-1/4 on the funds rate.  I™d be a little suspicious of our economy if our funds rate should go down to 4-1/4. I like the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 midpoint.   
MR. PARTEE.  What did you say about
 midpoint?  I didn™t hear it.   
MR. GARDNER.  Well, what I meant was 4-3/4 
and 4-7/8 [as alternative midpoints].  I™m 
only commenting on extending the full percentage poi
nt range from 5-1/4 to 4-1/4 on the funds 
rate.  I™m suggesting that we™d be doing some up
swing if the funds rate were down at 4-1/4.  We 
had a funds rate of 5, we had a funds rate of 5-1/2, 5-1/4 for quite a while--way down to 4-1/4 is a significant difference.   MR. PARTEE.  That, of course, would mean that 
the aggregates would be at the minimum.   
MR. GARDNER.  Listen, we don™t [know] all the shocks.  I guess we don™t think [there] are going to be [any], not in October anyway.   10/19/76 - 43 - 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we don™t know.  Well, gentlemen, we have to agree on the 
language of the directive.  I think the monetary aggregate directive using the innocuous language of alternative B would be proper, in view of today™s discussion.   MR. COLDWELL.  I came out differently on that, Mr. Chairman.  I came out with a 
money market proposal using the words ﬁseek
s to ease bank reserve and money market 
conditions.ﬂ  I keep hearing around this table people wanting to lower the funds rate.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s have a show of hands.  Let™s have a show of hands on the language of the directive.  How many would prefer a monetary aggregate directive this time?   
MR. BROIDA.  Nine, Mr. Chairman.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think there is 
a clear majority.  As to the [short-term] 
specifications, the majority of the Committee favors 
a range of 5 to 9 for Ml; 9 to 13 for M2; and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 for federal funds.  In view of the discussion that we™ve had, and in view of the 
minority which would seek a lower federal funds
, I think it would appropriate to take the 
midpoint--4-7/8--as the immediate target and to m
ove symmetrically around that midpoint as we 
normally do.   
So I would suggest that we vote on the following: monetary aggregates directive as 
described by the language of alternative B
, the growth of Ml within the range of 5 to 9, the growth rate for M2 of 9 to 13, a federal funds range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 with a move towards 4-7/8 
within a week or 10 days.  How would you like that
 worded Mr. Sternlight?  Within a week?   
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Within about a week.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Within about a week, all 
right.  Let™s put it that way, within about 
a week.   MR. BLACK.  This is regardless of the behavior of the aggregates, Mr. Chairman?   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, within about a week you™re not going to have much 
information.  I think that is the meaning, that 
regardless of the behavior of the aggregates, you move toward 4-7/8 and then you move up or
 down depending on incoming evidence on the aggregates.  And the move being restricted to 
3/8 of 1 percent in each direction.  Well, any 
questions?  If not, would you be good enough to call the roll.   MR. BROIDA.   
Chairman Burns  Yes  

Vice Chairman Volcker  Yes  

President Balles  Yes  

President Black  Yes  

Governor Coldwell  Yes  

Governor Gardner  Yes  

Governor Jackson  Yes  

President Kimbrel  Yes  

Governor Lilly  Yes  
10/19/76 - 44 - 
Governor Partee  Yes  
Governor Wallich  Yes  

President Winn  Yes  
It™s unanimous.   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  [For] the longer-range targets--and recognizing that our discussion is preliminary and the final decision will be ma
de on November 8--in expressing our views we 
can [unintelligible] preliminary discussion and 
we actually should ask ourselves the question, if we were to announce longer-range targets two or three days from now, wh
ere would we want to set them.  That™s the best we can do in discussi
ng the long-range targets in a preliminary way and 
depending on incoming data and second thoughts, wh
ich may be better than original thoughts.  
We may want to depart from tentative decisions
 we have made today. 
 All right, Mr. Eastburn, let™s start with you, please.   MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, we prepared
 a memorandum which we distributed to 
the members of the Committee, ma
king some suggestions about--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  May I just interrupt to 
say that--please feel free to proceed in your 
own way.  But I don™t think we can take up your suggestion today.  I think the proper way to take up your very interesting suggestion would be to have
 the staff analyze it, and let™s try to do that rather promptly and have the staff commen
t and evaluate your suggestion then.   MR. EASTBURN.  Yes, I was going to suggest th
at very thing.  I might
 just say one thing with respect to that memorandum.  That it obviou
sly owes a great debt both to Governor Wallich 
and Bill Poole, who advanced these kind of suggestions before and I think I should make sure 

that that is understood.   With respect to that memorandum, the thrust of
 it is that, for current decisions as far as long-run targets are concerned, to hold policy where it is, where we mean to make no change, 
would require an increase in the specified percentage growth rate.  That is, we have had a shortfall, and if we intend to hold policy where we meant it to be, then we would have to have 
some increase in specified percentages.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But is that a correct st
atement?  He says what he meant--well, 
now, wait, this is the correct statement for Ml, no
w there have been changes in the behavior of income velocity, we have learned something a
bout that.  There™s been substitution of time and 
savings deposits, demand deposits, there™s been ot
her changes in financial technology that we didn™t allow for right at the [unintelligible], knowing that these changes have occurred.  Is there a correction that needs to be made up?   
MR. EASTBURN.  Well, I think 
that would bear studying to see what the magnitude of 
that should amount to.  My guess is that, over this time period th
at we examine, we™ve had more 
drift than would be accounted for by those kinds of factors.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t know.  You see, this staff study that Mr. Axilrod referred to gave you some specific numbers, and it arrives at the conclusion that if the financial technology had been constant, Ml growth would have been almost 2 percentage points higher in 
10/19/76 - 45 - 
the past year than it turned out to be.  Now, so we have had some study devoted to that subject, 
and you know perfectly well how wrong the economi
cs profession has been in estimating the 
demand for money over the past year, year a
nd a half, or a bit longer than that.   MR. EASTBURN.  Well, I should think that wh
en the time comes to analyze the proposal, 
that that should be an important thing.  My 
offhand feeling is that 
at least our announcement 
would suggest that we™re some 6 billion below the fixed-based target, and I would suggest that 

that would be greater than would be allowed for in this philosophy.  The point I want to make, 
however, is that so far as the 
immediate determination of long-t
erm targets is concerned, I would 
come out different from your specification.  Rath
er than lowering the specifications for Ml, I would raise them.  I would have 5 to 7-1/2 
percent, midway between alternative A and 
alternative B:  5 to 7-1/2 percent for Ml; 9 to 11 for M2; and 11 to 13 for M3.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Coldwell please.   MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I™m not with you on the long term, like I was in the 
short-term.  I™m afraid the long-term targets you s
uggested are a bit low for me.  I™m not ready to 
take another notch off of this, partly because I ha
ve some of Dave™s feelings that we have not 
met what we set out to do.  I have sought some
what more stimulative policy a little bit around 
this table for months, but I think you really have
 not lived up to the level we set in front of ourselves as they™ve actually come in.  That™s
 partly the problem w
ith forecasting and other things characteristic of these Ms.   I think that [unintelligible] for the long range I would be willing to keep the bottom figure 
of 4-1/2 [for M1], but I would raise the top figur
e from 7 to 7-1/2 or even 8, partly because I 
think we™re reaching a point where we just can
not do a forecasting job on these figures, and 
we™re coming in so differently month-to-month a
nd even quarter-to-quarter, and yet we always seem to be at the bottom end of th
is package.  The M2 range of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, I™d actually prefer a 10 to 12; and on the M3, instead of the 9 to 11 we now have, well, it actually would be acceptable to me, but I rea
lly prefer a 9 to 12.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Just a factual point, the way figures have come out relative to our 
projection--or plan, if you like--at Ml we™ve been toward the lower end; M3, we™ve been toward the upper end; M2, we™ve been close to the midpoint
, and therefore, taking the three Ms together, I say we have been surprisingly close.   MR. COLDWELL.  Except that everybody looks
 at Ml instead of the other two.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we™ve learned better, and now we look at Ml and M2 at least, giving them approximately equal weight, 
as we had occasion to remind ourselves at this 
meeting.  Who would like to speak next? 
 Mr. Partee and then Mr. MacLaury.   
MR. PARTEE.  Mr. Chairman, I think that my 
preference as of today, if we were to announce this as you specified, in a matter of a few 
days, would be to hold just exactly the same 
Ml range we now have, 4-1/2 to 7.  And I do be
lieve that gives us room, which we may well 
need, to have a period of more
 rapid expansion in M1.   10/19/76 - 46 - 
My concern is with M2 and M3, because, you recall, we cut the upper end of those ranges the last time on the technical gr
ounds that it wasn™t reasonable, that the relationship didn™t seem 
to be reasonable.  Now I think in an atmosphe
re where interest rates may be lower than we 
previously have thought, we may r
un into difficulty with these on the top end.  And so I think I would be inclined--I wouldn™t like to make much of a cha
nge there, but I think I would be inclined to go back on the M2 and M3 to the ranges that we had specified prior to last time, that 
is, to undo what had been done before and on the same grounds that it was explained before, 
where we said, ﬁWell, technically, we think that 
the relationship is not quite right.ﬂ  But now we can say, ﬁWell, technically, in view of the way the markets have developed, we think that it was 
right before, and so we will return to those previous levels.ﬂ  Now, Steve, am I right in thinking 

we have reduced--was it a 1/2 point on one of them and 1 point on the other?   
MR. AXILROD.  A 1/2 point on M2 and 1 point off the top of M3 last time.   
MR. PARTEE.  And so what we would do [if we] 
go back, it will be 8 to 10 and 10 to 12?   
MR. AXILROD.  It was 7-1/2 to 10 and 9 to 12.   
MR. PARTEE.  7-1/2 to 10 and--  
MR. AXILROD.  The time before last.   

MR. PARTEE.  All right, I think that as of today that should be my thinking about it.  On 
the question of making further progress and ri
dding the economy of the monetary base for inflation, I just think that this is a desirable l
onger-run objective, but I just don™t think that, with 
the kinds of business news and employment news 
we™ve had, this is the time to make another 
step.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You say that in full recognition of the fact that, under my 
suggested range, we could still ease over a total of 12 months considerably.   
MR. PARTEE.  I say it for two reasons: one is, I™m afraid that 
the targets, what we think 
of--Ml and the range of M1--that the commentary would be that we™ve tightened another notch.  And I don™t think that™s a good commentary to have 
about us.  The second reason is at this stage and in the economic situation--   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the commentary w
ould be directed toward two sets of specifications.  The short-term specification, [whi
ch] will have eased, and the long-term, which 
may be interpreted as having tightened but which n
eed not be a tightening at all, for two reasons.  First, we haven™t used the upper part of the range, and there™s ample room to move from the 
present 5 as a low figure up to 6-1/2; and second, we are not slaves to the figures that we put down.  I™m not arguing, I simply
 wanted to clarify the--  MR. PARTEE.  My problem is, we would not be 
expressing the short-range targets that we have adopted now because that still would be secret at the time you make the presentation.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s a good question.   10/19/76 - 47 - 
MR. PARTEE.  And therefore it will be the long-term [specification] that™ll be the news.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s a good question, whether they should remain secret 
under the circumstances.  Well, let™s not debate th
at now.  I think that I have not thought about that.  You see, remember this, in the past, when
 we had to testify in the beginning of the year before the Joint Economic Committee--instead of
 allowing the lag of 90 days, we permitted the 
lag to fall below two months, eve
n.  In recognition of the fact that we had to testify before the congressional committee, we™ve deviated from that road.   
MR. PARTEE.  It™s a little different though, because you™ll be testifying at a time when the 
current specification is still the op
erating policy of the Committee.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, yes that™s true, but on the other hand, yeah that™s true and that would argue against specifying the short-term ranges.  However, the market rate for federal 
funds will be known, and what happens before the--  MR. PARTEE.  It might not be
 lower, Mr. Chairman.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I realize that.  I realiz
e that.  But the market rate will be known, 
and it may well be lower because we™re giving it a 
head start in that direction and moving rather 
promptly to 4-7/8.  I see your point, and I am glad
 you made the point because it will help me to 
think through a question that I hadn™t thought about before.   MR. PARTEE.  And my substantive point still was that I thi
nk we may need to use much 
of that Ml range [unintelligible] the period that is open to us, and therefore I don™t like to see us reduce our headroom.  And my final point is that
 we did have modest shortfalls in the last 
quarter, and then to be reducing the target range on the new base following a little shortfall 
would certainly bring comment, and I think it will seem [that it is
] a little more tightening that 
really is intended.  That™s my
 feeling as of this--   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s very understandable.  Mr. Volcker.  Oh, I™m sorry, Mr. 
MacLaury and then Mr. Volcker.   MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I 
guess I™m with Chuck so far as Ml is 
concerned.  I have been a partisan, as you know, of this knocking down on the Ml in particular, but I think that as things seem today, this woul
d be interpreted as an inappropriate time to do 
that, and I would concur in that judgment as things stand today.  
So I would stick with the 4-1/2 to 7 [for M1], mainly for the public interpretation 
aspects of it. On the other Ms, I think I again follow Chuck™s idea of going back to a new 7-1/2 to 10 and 9 to 12 as consistent with the seemingly different relationship be
tween the Ml and M2 figures.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Volcker please.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™ve just been listening around the table this afternoon, Mr. Chairman, and I do think there™s a little Ml 
myopia.  When I look at all these things, you didn™t go quite far enough according to the differe
nt ways of drawing these things.  Going 
backward, it does seem to me going on the high side
 of M2 and very much on the high side in 
M3 in terms of longer-term targets; 
we are on the low side of M1.   10/19/76 - 48 - 
When I look at the economics of these differe
nt things, M2 over a considerable period doesn™t make much sense to me.  I could never 
see the distinction betw
een the savings deposits at commercial banks and savings deposits elsewhere.
  It™s very convenient to use in the short run.  Those proxies should move together anyway, but looking over a longer period, the M3 numbers, 
which are more meaningful to me alongside the Ml
 ones, are really pretty high, and it concerns me.   
I think we have both a technical and economic 
problem here, as has been advised, with the 
[broader] Ms coming out higher relative to the Ml
 figure than people have expected, and that should be corrected if we have a chance to correct it because it will probably persist at the 

current level of interest rates.  When I put th
at together with the economic problem, it seems to 
me that all these specifications have lots of room
 for increasing any of the aggregates as much as 
I™d like to see them increased over the next ye
ar, almost regardless of business activity.  If 
business really slacked off, th
ese numbers, as they are, impl
y a very easy money market 
situation--extremely; you would probabl
y have trouble making these figures.   
MR. PARTEE.  Except in M2 and M3.  That would be very strong.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,
 the Ml, that™s right, the discrepancy will increase 
even more.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™d have enormous
 difficulty if you had a business recession reaching anything like the figure we have for M1.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  
So taking all these things
 into consideration and considering the long-range objective of moving them down--and they 
do still seem high to me in 
a secular way--given all the technical arguments you™ve made about Ml, to which I™d add the 
compensating balance thing, I very much like th
e idea of moving down the M1 figure.  I had 
actually thought of moving down 
the lower end of the range rather the upper, so that nobody would raise questions about it if pressures did go 
the other way.  We™d be committed to continue 
for a while, but I™d take either one and be perfectly happy with what you suggested.   Reluctantly, but in recognition of the technical problem, I could conceive, if we went down 
in M1 slightly, going up on the others equally slightly and getting some balance the same way, if 
someone attached great importance, as obviously 
some do, to the announcement effects.  I think 
that is of some importance, but
 since it runs a little contrary to what I would like to do in substance, I guess I would swallow the announcement effect.  And I think we can get by with it 
safely enough without moving the M2 and M3 up, even though I think it could be justified technically, in moving the M1 dow
n a little on the basis you suggested.  I would hate to see a general movement upward in these things, but it 
seems to me precisely in the opposite direction 
you want to go, and we™re already too high in the long-range perspective.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Mr. Mayo now, please.   MR. MAYO.  Well, I personally prefer, Mr. Ch
airman, sticking where we are, 4-1/2 to 7 
[for M1] with a rise in M2 to either 8 to 10 
or 8-1/2 to 10-1/2, which is the prescription in 
alternative B. 
 I didn™t consult with the doctor who prescribed alternative B
, but it seems to me 
that this does have some announcem
ent effect that is very slightly toward easing, and the only 10/19/76 - 49 - 
rationale, or the major rationale, 
for taking your prescription in preference to this--for Ml at 4-1/2 to 7--would be if you indeed did combine it with 
a rise of 8-1/2 to 10-1/2, and I think you could cover the possible, indeed, perhaps likely, misint
erpretation that we were squeezing too early 
here on the long-term ranges by doing that.  But I 
still have a preference for the way alternative 
B is stated by the staff.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Wallich please.   
MR. WALLICH.  Well, I would go with the 4-1/
2 to 6-1/2 on M1.  I think the logic of gradually cutting each time is quite hard to resist
 because one begins to wobble when it becomes 
a controversial action.  Whereas if one does something of this cutting kind, no matter in which of 
the aggregates and whether the upper or lower edge of the band, one follows a continuing principal that makes sense.  Eventually we™ve got
 to come down to lower rates of money growth 
and never will unless we move in that direction.   
The real significance, I think, of today™s action in any event is what we do on the two-month targets.  On the longer targets, they have significance, but we™re not really trapped into 
those, we can change them.  Besides, base drift, although I™ve been concerned about it, is something that I wouldn™t readily give up because
 it™s a great safeguard and may stand in some 
good stead some day.  I don™t feel too concerne
d about the longer-run aggregates, and I™d go 
with the same specification for M2 and M3 that we have at the present time.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallic
h.  Mr. Kimbrel next, please.   
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, like Governor 
Wallich, I too am in total agreement with 
the long-term policy of gradually reducing our longer-range targets, particularly in recognition of our reduced inflation.  I therefore would like very much to see us 
inch down to the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 [range for M1,] particularly since we have not really been using that range, as you™ve pointed out.  In fact, continued low interest rates do make the savings 
and time deposits attractive, and 
maybe it would be technically fair--and as was 
suggested earlier, maybe it would have some 
announcement effect--if we rightfully eased [M2] 
back to 8 to 10.  I have no trouble with what you pointed out, but if I had a particular preference, I guess I would prefer to have 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 [for M1] and 8 to 10 on M2.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimb
rel.  Mr. Morris now, please.   MR. MORRIS.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that 
what I would do this session is to present the same numbers you presented the last time, al
l the way.  I think given the softness in the economy, I would be concerned about scaling back 
in any of the numbers at this time, even 
though I think that, quite clearly, as a long-term proposition, that™s wh
at we have to do.  I think the timing, however, might be unfortunate.  And 
while I sympathize with Mr. Partee™s technical 
reasons for raising M2 and M3, and I think as a technical matter there™s a lot that could be said 
for it, by the same token I wouldn™t want to be ra
ising the limits in this environment either.  I 
think you may or may not be able to persuade 
the Committee that you are doing it for technical 
reasons, but I think the press would not report the technical explanations but simply the 
upgrading.  So I think the safest thing, the best thing would be, for one time, present no changes.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Jackson now, please.   10/19/76 - 50 - 
MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I would not wa
nt to see us lower the upper end of M1 today.  I think if you listen to our staff™s projections for the next year, over which this time 
framework is proposed--while admittedly an overall re
duction in the growth of that aspect of our monetary policy is appropriate, I don™t know that it™s appropriate considering the economic 
projection.   I would disagree with the likely consequences of the relationship between that type of M1 growth and the M2, M3 growth.  I would suspect that, here again, in this trading off between the breakpoint of the arbitrary price mechanism that 
we call Regulation Q, as the short-run operating aspects have traded one side or the other to that, it has produced distortions in the rates of growth in M2 and M3.  And in the longer-term context, 
the experience that we have seems closer to our 
longer-run targets [unintelligible] the more likely consequence of the two.   
There™s another reason why I would hesitate to increase them, and 
that is, to the extent that 
M2 and M3 are becoming transactional as we di
scussed, it strikes me that increasing those 
ranges by whatever mechanistic means would be a mistake and certainly out of character with 

our attitude about M1.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Balles please.   MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, there has been 
one aspect of switching to a third-quarter base that I don™t think has been fully brought out yet, and perhaps the staff could do the homework on this and let us know in this fort
hcoming conference call in early November.  My 
impression--I don™t have the figures
, even tentative figures, in front of me--is that moving to a 
third-quarter base will in effect mean an upward drift in the base
 of M2 and a downward drift in the base of M1.  Is that approximately correct?  Steve?   
MR. AXILROD.  Yeah, we tried to explain it, yeah they go in different directions, and we™ve tried to explain the effects in the footnote on page 6 in the Bluebook.  And that™s very elliptical and possibly unclear, but the new alternative C in the long run gets you the same M2 
and M3 as if you had continued the existing gr
owth rates, and for Ml if you go to another alternative, between 
alternatives A and B. MR. BALLES.  Thank you, Steve.  That confirms the general impression I had, Mr. 
Chairman, even though we don™t have the exact nu
mbers worked out yet.  For that reason, along 
with the further reason that we had some incons
istency, I believe, between our target ranges on Ml versus M2 and M3.  As for an example, M2
 has grown about 4-1/2 percent faster than Ml 
ever since March 1975, and if you take the New Yo
rk Bank projections, that™s going to continue right on through March ™77.  But the differential in the targeted growth midpoints has averaged 
only 3 percent, and now it™s only 2-3/4 percent in the current setup.  And I think we™ve got an inconsistent set of ranges here.   Well, this is the long way around this thing--the downward drift in Ml base and the upward drift in M2 base that we will 
get by moving to a third-quarter ba
se from a second-quarter base.  
And I think we can solve that problem by adopting Frank Morris™s proposal, which I now associate myself with.  Leave the whole thing unchanged.   
10/19/76 - 51 - 
I™m very concerned about the announcement eff
ect.  The thing that got the headline last time when you announced a lowered upper limit 
for both M2 and M3 was that the Fed is tightening.  What really counts is what we do within the range and not so much the range itself, but we™d have a big difficulty in overcomi
ng an impression among the public that we™re tightening if we lower the upper end of these rang
es because of this uncertainty in the economy 
that I have earlier discussed.  I would come out
 in favor of leaving the ranges unchanged this time around.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. MacLaury you have another observation on any of these things?   
MR. MACLAURY.  If I may very briefly.  Ha
ving sat around this table for many years, I 
can™t remember many occasions in which anybody has changed his mind as a result of the 

discussion.  But I would like to avow that at the moment and say that, list
ening to the discussion, I have changed my mind, and I think that tec
hnicalities are pushing us in the direction of reducing the range of Ml in comparison with the 
other Ms.  Likewise the 
technicalities according 
to the preliminary impression you gave us today is
 telling us that Ml now means something more 
if it is adjusted for the shifting to [the nontransaction component of] M2 than the basic numbers 
imply.  Therefore I™d like to, I think this is cons
istent, accept your proposal for 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 but offset the psychological effects of announcing a downward revision there by a 1/2 point increase  in the other two Ms.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.   
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Ca
n I interject another time a
nd make an assertion, and 
the staff can tell me I™m wrong--or somebody else.  
My memory is that previous changes in the 
long-range targets have been so small that th
at there™s almost no a
nnouncement effect.  I don™t 
recall the market recoiling in horror or praise in any of these announcements.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, Mr. Black, we haven™t heard from you.   
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I would come 
out where Messrs. Morris and Balles come 
out and leave the ranges unchanged from what they were last tim
e.  I could live with a knocking off a 1/2 percentage point of Ml, but I believe it would be preferable not to do that at this 
particular time, although I would hope it would not
 get up to 7 percent at the same time.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Gardner.   MR. GARDNER.  I agree with Henry on Ml.  And your proposal, I think that™d be the proper approach--I™m not so sure about the 8-1/
2 to 10-1/2 and 10 to 12 for M2 and M3.  We™ve 
been reminded of significantly [unintelligible] hi
gher end of those, and last time [unintelligible] 
seems to be a little uncertain.  But I think the 
philosophy is a change, and the recognition of the technical factors in offsetting perhaps or sim
ilarly explaining what we™re doing on Ml leads me, 
finally, after listening to this very active discussion, to go along with the proposal.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner.  Mr.--I don™t have anyone left.  Mr. Lilly.   10/19/76 - 52 - 
MR. LILLY.  I would join the forces to say 
make no changes because I am so concerned 
about the announcement effect.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Lilly.  Mr. Guffey, Mr. Roos, would you like to comment?   
MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, I pref
er staying where we are.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Roos.  Mr. Guffey.   MR. GUFFEY.  [Unintelligible] philosophy, I like the idea of taking a cut in several quarters, but I think I would prefer to stay where we are [now]. 
 Ninety days from now, we can 
make hopefully a cut in one or
 the other of the ranges.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The Committee is evenly
 divided on Ml as between 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 and staying where we are at 4-1/2 
to 7.  As for M2, there is a majo
rity for 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, which is where we are now.  As for M3, there is a majori
ty in favor of 9 to 11, which is where we are now.   Well, gentlemen, I don™t think we need to go bey
ond this.  Let™s keep in mind the results of 
this preliminary discussion.  For M2 and M3, a 
clear majority of the 
Committee will prefer to 
stay where we are.  And on Ml, an equal number 
prefer 4-1/2 to 7, and [thus] staying where we 
are, [as] prefer to go down a 1/2 point on the upper 
limit.  I don™t think I want to argue the point 
now.   We will have another go at it 23 days from now
, and I expect to be in a position to [present 
altered long-run specifications to] this Committee 
if necessary.  But as of today I™m entirely 
satisfied with the expressions of opinion we have had.  And I would be eternally grateful to that member of this Committee who would be bold 
enough to suggest that we adjourn.  Thank you very much.  What I said, 23 days, was wrong, it was 20 days.   
END OF MEETING
