April 20, 1976  
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, gentlemen, we™ll get our meeting under way.  As you all 
know, we have scheduled a luncheon in honor of George Clay at 1 o™clock.  And also, sad to say, this is the last meeting that Governor Holland 
will be attending, and we™ll break bread with Mr. Holland at luncheon on the day of our May meeting.   
First item on the agenda is to take care of th
e minutes of the March meeting.  Is there a 
motion to approve? SPEAKER(?).  So move. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been made 
and I hope seconded.  They™re approved.  Now let™s turn to Mr. Holmes, who will report on foreign currency operations. 
MR. HOLMES.  [Secretary's note: This statement was not found in Committee records.]   

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Holmes. 
 Any question or comment?  Mr. Black, 
please. 
MR. BLACK.  Yes, really a simple one.  Alan, do you think the efforts of the Japanese to 
promote the use of the yen as a reserve curren
cy are going to have any significant long-run impact on the demand for dollars? 
MR. HOLMES.  I™m not sure about that one.  
This is something we have under study right 
at the minute.  I™m not quite sure of all the measur
es they have taken.  It seems to me that it can 
work both ways.  You know, reserve currencies can be hit with big withdrawals as well as big gains.  And so I™m not sure whether, over the lo
ng run, it has any great implications for the yen-dollar relationship, but I™m certainly 
not clear on that at the moment. 
MR. PARDEE.  It would have some implicatio
ns for the yen-dollar [relationship] since there will be more purchases of
 yen and holdings of yen, but in our experience the yen-dollar relationship is independent of the [dollar™s] relationships with [currencies in] Europe, so it™s sort of in a separate channel.  So we™ll not have a generalized effect, as far as the U.S. dollar is 
concerned, against other currencies. MR. BLACK.  I gather you do not expect to use the yen as an intervention currency, necessarily, if they did move toward it as a reserve currency. 
MR. PARDEE.  No, I don™t think so, perhaps over the long run some of the other countries 
in Asia might make specific use of the yen as 
an intervention currenc
y, but that™s a long way down the road. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All ri
ght, yes, Mr. Partee. 4/20/76 - 2 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  Just for the record, if the Mexicans devalue the peso, we™re fully covered aren™t we? MR. HOLMES.  Yes, we would be
 covered in the swap drawing. MR. PARTEE.  On that side, there™s no sharing for that responsibility, on the other side of 
this. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think it might be useful 
at this point, Alan, 
if you informed the 
Committee a little more precisely about the safeguard
s we have taken in the case of the Italian line. 
MR. HOLMES.  Gladly, Mr. Chairman.  First, 
in our cable to the Italians renewing the swap for three months, we made it quite clear that
 we have every expectation that that would be paid at the end of that three-month period.  S
econdly, we reiterated our understanding that they had pledged borrowings either under the EC oil facility or the IMF to repay the swap.  Now this is what we said formally in a wire.   
In addition, we are watching their reserve position very closely.  We know at the moment 
where they stand, what they have available stil
l from the EC oil facility, which they should be 
getting later this month, and thei
r [position with] the IMF.  And while we haven™t established a firm trigger point, I think we™re going to have to
 watch very carefully, and as soon as reserves come down, we™re going to have to
 insist, if they continue to come down, that they repay the 
swap.  But [that would be] long before they™re out 
of reserves altogether because I don™t think we 
want to be the one to take their last $500 millio
n away from them.  This would be my feeling, 
Mr. Chairman.   
There have been other conversations directly with the Italians.  They have a really tough political situation.  If they could solve that, you could see some hope, but until something 
happens there, it™s very hard to see any real solution.  Fortunately, the lira in the last four or five days--of course, the market was closed for a long
 Easter weekend, and that certainly helped--the lira tended to stabilize around 875 after having been as low as 916 without intervention.  In fact, they acquired a few million dollars.  Sco
tt, what was the quote this morning? 
MR. PARDEE.  874-875. 
MR. HOLMES.  874-875, so it seems to have stab
ilized, at least for the time being, on its 
own, and I think the Italians are quite realistic in knowing they can™t defend any particular rate.  They just can™t afford it, and they are as aware of the paucity of their reserves as anybody else. MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, on the Mexican
 thing, probably a fairly minor detail.  
They have drawn about two to three times the 
amount of currency from the Federal Reserve 
offices in the Eleventh District pre-Easter this year than they normally do.  On the other side of 
it, I guess it™s the other side of the same th
ing, there seems to be an unusual amount of shopping 
by Mexicans in the border cities in Texas this year, indicating 
that they have apparently passed word to the inspectors at the borde
r to be a little more liberal 
with people carrying merchandise 
back from this country.  They drew $31 million 
in 50s and 100s from our shops in the week 
before Easter.   4/20/76 - 3 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  These are interesting facts.  What is your interpretation of these 
facts? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Well, there is
 more.  It is our impre
ssion that there is more 
speculation now in terms of conve
rsation about a possible devaluation this year than there has been in recent years, and presumably the managers
 of the Central Bank of Mexico felt that they would have a heavier demand for U.S. currency, a
nd they wanted to be in a position to supply without question in the interest of trying to quiet or hold down this rising conversation.  And I would think the same thing might well be true w
ith respect to the shopping across the border.   If they could convey an impression to their people that they are in a position to accommodate at least the usual amount and mayb
e more than the usual amount of buying of 
foreign merchandise, then that would also he
lp to quell the concern about a devaluation. MR. COLDWELL.  In the past, Mr. Chairman, 
in situations like this--we™ve had them 
recurring, I guess, about every four to six years--the orders that Ernie refers to of 50s and 100s, I think you will find them coming back to him very pr
omptly.  And they come back in the form of 
people moving their money out of Mexico.  Usua
lly with the use of the 100 dollar bill down there.   
MR. BAUGHMAN.  It gives us a little operating problem in that we have to round this up, 
pass it out, and then process it when it comes back. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. MacLaury. 

MR. MACLAURY.  Alan, you mentioned in your 
comments that we had no requests from 
the Bank of England for a drawing.  I just wanted to ask whether we had done any anticipatory thinking as to how we might react to such a request for a drawing by the British, and can you cite 
conversations that, given a new budget, that this might  provide the sources for intervening. MR. HOLMES.  They have ample reserves for the time being.  If, however, for some 
reason they thought it would be useful to draw on the swap, and they still had their package intact and that was a clear takeout, then I personally think that we should be sympathetic to a 
British drawing.  But as I say, they seem to
 have ample reserves if they come in. 
MR. WALLICH.  I™d like to in
ject, Mr. Chairman, that th
ere is a growing understanding internationally that the swap lines are not simply
 available for the asking.  There have to be negotiations, conditions, and circumstances that ma
ke it plausible that they will be paid off 
within the proper time.  Now, in the past, this 
repayment often has been based on the expectation 
of a turnaround in the balance in 
payments and capital flows.  U
nder conditions such as today™s, 
this has become a little less plau
sible for some countries, and as
 a result we have increasingly 
leaned on specific takeouts like an IMF drawing or 
the EC loan.  I think it is beginning to be understood that these are bridging credits. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There™s no takeout provision in the Mexican drawing, is there? 4/20/76 - 4 - 
    MR. HOLMES.  No, there is no takeout pr
ovision on the Mexican drawing, but we do know that they have rights in the [International Monetary] Fund.  I mean, this is in the 
background, there is nothing specific. MR. PARDEE.  When I talked wi
th them, I made it very clear 
that we would look to their Fund drawing rights as a takeout 
if necessary.  This is the way we have always handled it, 
making very clear what the takeout would be, but 
not [making a specification] as we have in the 
Italian case and, as Alan has suggested, in the Britis
h case.  That is, not making it a specific firm 
condition of the drawing that the funds be there.  They understand the background to it, but we haven™t formally made it a 
condition of the drawing. MR. JACKSON.  Alan, have there been any developments in Italian private debt as a 
consequence of all this? MR. HOLMES.  I know of no recent deve
lopments.  As you know, many banks are 
concerned about some of their It
alian loans, and that concern certainly continues, but I don™t know of any specific development that indicates 
a crackdown on the private credit side.  I think it would be much harder for Italian private firms to borrow, although an Italian bank is borrowing $60 million this week. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions?  Thank you very much, Mr. Holmes.  Now, 
at this point a motion to confirm the transacti
ons of the Foreign [Trading] Desk would be in order. MR. COLDWELL.  So move. 

SPEAKER(?).  Second. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The motion has been s
econded.  I hear no objection.  Mr. Holmes, 
do you have any recommendation with respect to-- 
MR. HOLMES.  Well, there are swap drawings
 up for renewal in the next month.  I™ve 
already mentioned the Bank of It
aly drawing, which falls due on this Thursday but has been rolled over for three months.   
We also have the first renewal of $54 m
illion in [deutsche] mark drawings on the 
Bundesbank coming up in early May.  I™d like to
 recommend renewal, but I would hope we can 
repay that drawing before maturity.  We have most
 of the funds accumulated toward that already.   
The second--and this is more painful--the
 full $191 million pre-1971 Belgian franc [swap 
debt] and the full $1,147 million of Swiss franc swap
 debt is again up for renewal, and, I™m sad 
to say, it is for the 19th time.  We have made
 some pretty good progress in getting the Belgian 
debt down, but as I™ve noted, we™ve only made a 
very small dent on the Swiss franc debt, given 
the strength of that currency.  I reluctantly have to recommend 
renewal, since there is nothing else we can do, but we would hope that we can continue to make
 at least some progress on the 
eventual settlement of both of these debts. 
4/20/76 - 5 - 
    MR. COLDWELL.  May I ask a question, Mr. Ch
airman?  We™ve talked about these two 
debts for a long time.  Are we still making some 
efforts to get Treasury to bail us out of this? MR. HOLMES.  We have not recently, we™ve 
been going ahead all right on the Belgian [debt]--I think I™m quite satisfied that we™re right 
on target.  It™s the Swiss one that is the tough 
thing, and you know the Treasury has its own debt in Swiss francs.  We™re under no pressure 
from the Swiss to repay.  They™ve been very coop
erative in trying to devise procedures by which the markets [unintelligible] in 
favor of the dollar.  We can m
ove ahead, and we have acquired some Swiss francs in off-the-market deals, but 
we have not been going into the market because I 
don™t believe that™s appropriate given the strength of the Swiss franc.  These are very small 
amounts relative to our debt.  It w
ould take a major turn in the ex
change markets for us to make 
real progress. MR. WALLICH.  And we have
 achieved a relatively favorable loss-sharing proposition with the Swiss. MR. HOLMES.  Yes, but we still have more 
losses to share with them--that™s the thing. 
MR. COLDWELL.  We aren™t even attempting to
 ask the Treasury to take us out of this? MR. HOLMES.  We have in the past, and I™d be
 glad to renew that, but let me say that I 
don™t think there is much chance of positive action right now. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, as a nag about our debt
s on the swap line drawings, I am pleased 
enough with the progress on the Belgian side to be glad to move its renewal.  And I™m happy I 
won™t be here to have to move the umpteenth renewal of the Swiss one. MR. BLACK.  I suggest that he ought to stay at least until we had that.  He said [we had] made such progress that he felt free to leave. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think it would 
be useful, Alan, for the subcommittee to 
take up the question raised by Mr. Coldwell, and I doubt that we can make
 any progress at this meeting, but I do think we ought to sit down, a
nd we might even call on Messrs. Volcker and 
MacLaury--we know how to tempt the Treasury fo
r assistance in our deliberations at the subcommittee level.  I take it that we have
 a motion before us to accept the Manager™s 
recommendations. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Second. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And has been seconded.  I hear no objections, and I take it that the motion is approved.  Let™s turn now to Mr. Gramley™s report on the economic outlook. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Zeisel will [begin] our comments this 
morning with a review of recent economic developments. 
MR. ZEISEL.  [Secretary's note: This statemen
t was not found in Committee records.]  Mr. 
Gramley will now complete our [presentation with a discussion of policy alternatives]. 
4/20/76 - 6 - 
    MR. GRAMLEY.  [Secretary's note:
 This statement was not found in Committee records.]   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gramley. 
 I™d like to ask one question.  How do you reconcile, Lyle, the Commerce figure of 7-1/
2 percent annual rate of growth and physical volume of the nation™s total production with the 
Federal Reserve™s more restricted measure of 
industrial production, which shows a 
low rate of growth?  Now, I don™t think that is an easy 
exercise. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  If I remember the numbers ri
ght, the index of industrial production on a quarterly average basis did go up more than 7-1/2 percent [unintelligible]
.  What is puzzling, and 
you are right in this connection, is that the rate of increase of industrial production slowed from 
the fourth quarter to the first, whereas the rate
 of increase in real GNP increased from 5 to 
7-1/2 percent.  My best guess is that we may be suffering from
 some potential revision in the 
industrial production numbers for March. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s interesting.  This has been my guess, that the 
[unintelligible] may be that the Department of
 Commerce is now overestimating the increase.  
I™ve had the uneasy feeling for some time that 
our industrial production index is understating the rate of growth. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  There is a real possibility 
that, when we get the April employment 
figures in, we will find that the March decline 
in the average length of the work week was a 
statistical aberration, and this may then in tu
rn [unintelligible] with revision in the March 
production index.  It is a puzzle, and these puzzles do occur on a quarterly basis not infrequently, and it sometimes takes some time for them to be resolved. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Are we still usin
g about 50 percent man-hour data? 
MR. ZEISEL.  I think it™s about 40 percent for one month.  In subsequent months the 
weight of the man-hours [
unintelligible] sharply. MR. GRAMLEY.  But that March estimate that
 we put up would be heavily based on the man-hour figure. 
MR. WALLICH.  Could I ask a 
question about this table, Mr. Chairman?  I find puzzling 
some of the projections here.  It
 is a hard thing to estimate the 
consequences of M1 growth, but I note for instance [regarding] unemployment that a 1-
1/2 percent difference in the rate of growth in real GNP is associated only with a minute 0.2 
[percentage point] difference in the level of unemployment.  I would have expected someth
ing closer to 0.4 or 0.5 bearing in mind the 
familiar 3-to-1 rule of thumb here. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Governor, I think what you need
 to look at is the level of real GNP by the end of the projection period because, while the rate
s of growth are quite different by the end of this period, that is true just in the final part of the projection period.  The level of real GNP 
with the alternatives is not as large as the growth rate might suggest--th
at™s less than 1 percent difference in real GNP by the end of this projection period. 4/20/76 - 7 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  The other point I have is the exp
ected effect of the Treasury bill rate.  It has been frequently suggested that at least [for] the long-term rates, a change in the rate of money growth might have not th
e typical effect [in which] th
e faster money growth reduces 
interest rates but may actually, th
rough expectations, raise them.  Here at the short-term end, the assumption seems to be very clear that over a peri
od of five quarters, short-term rates will move 
significantly in the direction in which one would traditionally have expected--that is, an increase in the supply of money continue
s to reduce the short-term rate. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  The model has no direct expecta
tional effect built into it.  I am inclined 
to the view that, if we are talking about policy alternatives which differ by these amounts, we 
might reasonably neglect expectational effect
s and reckon that this would be a probable alternative course of rates that would emerge.  I think that that assumption would become much 
more questionable if we were talking about more divergent 
policy alternatives. MR. WALLICH.  I see.  Thank you. 

MR. PARTEE.  While [we are] on the tabl
e [discussed by Mr. Wallich], I think it is 
correct, Lyle, and I would like to remind the Comm
ittee that what really these alternatives one, 
two, and three show are the differences that you would expect to result if you had a little higher money growth, a little lower mone
y growth.  That is, the basic presumption is that the 6 percent 
rate of money growth would bring an incr
ease in real GNP of some 5 percent. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  That is correct. 

MR. PARTEE.  And that is the judgmental pr
ojection, and all the alternatives are giving you are the implied differentials that would result from those altern
atives.  So all these figures look disappointingly low to me in terms of real 
growth rates.  But then the question is, is the judgmental projection likely to be 
accurate or not?  Is the base ra
te of growth in real GNP likely to be cruising down here around 5 percent or could it be higher?  This table, of course, doesn™t 
answer that. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s correct. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think on that point, as Mr. Zeisel suggested, were these 
projections being made today in
stead of yesterday and the day before, they would probably be higher, that™s point number one.  Point number 
two, the differences between the several lines 
corresponding to different rates of growth of M1 appear small as compared with the difference of 
the 5-1/2 percent figure [for GNP] estimated by our
 staff and the 7-1/2 percent figure estimated 
by the Commerce Department for the first quarter of
 this year.  Therefore it is very difficult for 
me to take these figures as being more than
 indicative of the probable direction intended. MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s the way we would wish 
it to be interpreted, particularly in view 
of the considerable uncertainty we face as to th
e amount of money that is
 needed to finance any 
given increase in gross national product.  That makes an exercise of this sort all the more 
difficult.   4/20/76 - 8 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, because you really are relying on a model that, during the 
past 18 or 20 months, has produced poor esti
mates of the relationship between money and 
economic activity. 
MR. PARTEE.  But we don™t know that the differentials are increased. MR. GRAMLEY.  And we don™t know
 that they are not, Governor Partee.  That™s where 
the source of the uncertainty lies. 
MR. PARTEE.  All we are using the model for 
is to estimate the differentials from the 
basic judgmental projection. MR. MAYO.  To come back to the point, if 
we made these projections today rather than yesterday we would have a little different picture.  I somehow 
got the impression, with the quick 
review of the first-quarter report, that so much of
 this is inventory--in which figures I have very little confidence anyway--that I am not sure th
at, in, perhaps, a conservative mood I wouldn™t 
stick with what we have.  I™m not sure that my
 opinion of the staff forecast has changed much as 
a result of the publication of the first quarter.  Would the staff care to comment on that? MR. GRAMLEY.  I™d be happy to, President 
Mayo.  The impression has been gained 
[from] the statistics in the newspaper that final sales 
rose relatively weakly in the first quarter.  In fact, that reflects the decline in net exports.  If you take a look at private final sales excluding net exports, they went up at a 7.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, which is a very strong increase.  If you put in the government [purchases],
 the increase is not so large--on the order of 6 percent, but that™s still a good increase.  I would not interpret these first-quarter results as implying the necessity of radical changes in our for
ecast, but this is certainly not a weak report.   
MR. MAYO.  I had interpreted it, perhaps superficially, Lyle, at least in part, as a moving 
up of inventory accumulation earlier than we had 
expected.  But that, you would say, is not the 
major lesson to be learned. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I think that is the major lesson. 

MR. MAYO.  You do? MR. GRAMLEY.  I think that is the major thi
ng that led to a stronge
r forecast, a stronger 
first quarter than we had anticipated.  But I would want to stress the fact that 
this would by no means be suggestive of involuntary accumulation of
 inventories.  We did not see a weak final 
sales picture in the first quarter, and I would re
mind the Committee also that
 this is an estimate 
based on two months of inventory, 
and not all the price data that are needed to evaluate the 
inventory [unintelligible], so I th
ink we ought to wait just a bit.  
I would also note in this connection that the thing that would concern me most in terms of 
potential underestimation of expansive forces w
ould be evidence that business attitudes toward inventory accumulation have changed in a signifi
cant way.  We are now [unintelligible] to build up stocks to high levels, and in this connection the Redbook tells a very different story.  It tells a story of a business community that 
is still being very cautious.   4/20/76 - 9 - 
    MR. WINN.  I sense, however, Lyle, a cha
nge taking place very quickly in business attitudes along this line.  For example, in steel, they cleaned ou
t inventory from one end of the 
system to the other.  They are now actually talk
ing allocations by the third quarter in a few lines 
and real allocations by the fourth quarter.  They are expecting that the first quarter earnings are not going to be too much of an improvement over 
the first quarter of last year, but they are expecting to put super earnings together back to back in the second and third quarter.  That™s going to be the basis for the real plant expansion that has to come if we are going to see growth 
over a period of time, and they are really 
talking about fantastic kinds of numbers. 
Now, if you get to this allocation problem, the th
ing that is going to be reflected, of course, is price changes.  And that™s the sort of thing that is bothersome.  In the rubber industry, for 
example, they are talking about 8 percent tire pric
e increases without the cost-of-living aspect of [their labor negotiations] that they are fighting very desperately.  But [industrial customers] don™t 
look for any shortage of tires fr
om manufacturers because they all have private companies that 
are outside the big four that will take over if [the unionized wo
rkers] strike, so the strike doesn™t really pose a real problem for them in that sense 
of the term.  The paper industry is talking about 
allocation by the fourth 
quarter of this year.  So you really get a dramatic kind of a change in attitude.  But figuring what this is going to 
do to price--I suspect you are going to get a 
swing back because everybody will scramble for 
inventory with this kind of a 
shift that™s taking place.   
The other side of this thing is the feeling that we may be starting to
 have more trouble in the [unintelligible] reactions--their feeling is that the comeback
 is all political, and they are 
[now] very quiet.  But they feel that they have been ﬁhadﬂ in the la
st economic downturn, and 
they are going to be quite aggressive to catch up, and so you see it in the cost of living effort [in contract negotiations].  But I think in the labor set-up you are going to see an even more dramatic 
kind of solution to get economic 
recovery.  If [the unions] become convinced that things are 
really good, I think you are going to see a far more aggressive attitude than we have seen in the 
last several years. MR. COLDWELL.  Did you say that the automob
ile makers can surviv
e a 90- to 120-day rubber strike with no [unintelligible]? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I thought it was 60 days. MR. WINN.  I don™t know what the set-up is. 
 You know, the companies have their own 
private companies.  You™ve got Kelly and Springfield and all of those.  And the automobile companies have stockpiled some tires in anticipa
tion of a strike, and they feel that these other 
manufacturers can pick up the slack, so th
ey don™t feel as exposed as you might think. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Well, I recogniz
ed that there was some flexib
ility in that, but I didn™t 
think the flexibility was very large in the [potential] size of pickup by the [unintelligible].  MR. WINN.  [Vehicle manufactur
ers] have put all of their new investment into the 
independents.  They haven™t put it into their own companies, so
 you™ve had Kelly and some of 
these with big plant expansions.  This has been their effort to deal with so
me of these problems.  
You™ve got more flexibility there than you think. 
4/20/76 - 10 - 
    MR. MAYO.  We understand that the majors ha
ve a significant stockpile inventory, too, quite apart from the independents, but 
in truck tires it™s a more serious-- 
MR. WINN.  I think that is correct. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Figures I™
ve heard are a 30-day leeway for the truck manufacturers 
and 60 days for the automobiles. MR. MAYO.  60-90 [for automobiles] and 
maybe as much as 30 [for trucks]. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just to return to the general economic outlook question.  
First quarter [unintelligible] were certainly affected by inventories that we didn™t anticipate, and I share some of Bob Mayo™s questioning about that.  
But I should say that the final sales, as Lyle mentioned, have been sharply affected by net expor
ts, which we would not expect to continue in terms of a decline.  Certainly, we have been look
ing at numbers in New York that are in this case 
significantly higher than what the Board has been projecting, ranging higher by roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point, quarter by quarter. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This is for real GNP? 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  R
eal GNP over the next year. MR. PARTEE.  5-1/2 to 6 percent is your range? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  For the time periods I have
 here, it runs about 6 percent beginning on a quarterly basis, depending upon whether you go a year ahead or 18 months ahead. 
MR. BLACK.  Lyle, the thing that intrigues me 
more than anything else about this is that all this inventory building seems to
 have been financed primarily from internal sources.  This, of 
course, gets into Steve™s area as to what this
 may mean for credit demands later on and for the 
money supply ultimately, too, if inventories are built up.   
And as I start kicking those figures around, I wonder if the loan demand is going to be 
anything like as strong and if there is going to be anything like as much upward pressure on 
interest rates in the business sector.  Look at the internal flows of cash in businesses--the financing gap they™ve got looks pretty small, th
e commercial paper rate of 7-1/2 percent looks 
like a pretty sharp jump, yet they™re able to
 do all this without external financing. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Let me say one thing about in
ternal sources.  As I interpret business loan figures, I think we are still getting a very substantial improvement of corporate profits going 
there.  The fourth quarter numbers don™t show anyt
hing in that regard; they show profits leveling out.  But if you look at the statistics for the fourth quarter, what you find is that we had an 
enormous shift in the statistical
 discrepancy in the GNP accounts, from a minus 3 to a plus 5.  
That means that product went up more than in
come did, and it may well be that subsequent 
revisions of the numbers will indicate that we have had more growth [unintelligible] than we 

know about. 4/20/76 - 11 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  President Black, we would suspect
 that the internal [cash] flows remain 
very strong relative to business need.  But we expect needs for funds to creep up relative to internal flows, so that while we don™t have a large financing gap developing later this year and in early ™77, we do have a financing gap developing.  And we would expect it to be reflected more 
in short-term borrowing than in any pickup in long-term borrowing, that is, we would expect 
long-term borrowing to stay about where it is 
or perhaps come down some because a lot of 
restructuring of debt has been done.   We would expect the rising short-term borrowing to put some additional pressure on 
banks, reducing the banks™ ability to buy government
 securities, shifting some of the need to buy 
government securities over into 
the nonbank public and also increasing banks™ issuance of CDs.  Those two factors are putting generalized upward pressure on short rates and also, by extension, on commercial paper, so those would be the underlying credit shifts that we believe would accompany the projection of rising short rates, given our assumption [unintelligible]. 
MR. BLACK.  I would agree with the line of your reasoning.  It™s just a question of degree.  And I guess I was just probably premature in
 asking that at that point.  The gap is so small in relation to what I think the needs will be
 that I would not think there would be that much 
upward pressure for some unknown reason.   Have we ever had this much inventory building, Lyle, from internal sources?  I cannot 
remember any time when you™ve had this much swing without some pickup in business loan 

demand. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I would have to go back and 
look at the statistics much more closely.  
The weakness in business loan demand through the four
th quarter didn™t surprise us all that much 
because inventories were still dec
lining at that time.  The weakness 
in the first quarter gets more 
puzzling, but I don™t know whether or not this is an exception which is so outstanding as to be without parallel. MR. PARTEE.  The interest in internal funds is very sharp, very much more than-- 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, no question about that. 
MR. PARTEE.  So you could, I presume,
 finance a larger inventory--  MR. GRAMLEY.  Right. 

MR. PARTEE.  --with those increased internal funds. 
MR. MACLAURY.  I want to weigh in on the side of saying that the outlook is stronger than the Greenbook forecast.  Our research staff in Minneapolis had revised upward its first-

quarter figures before we got the Commerce Department figures.  And th
erefore we were very 
surprised to see the Board staff going in the opposite direction on that occasion.  And as you know, for the past six months or so, we have been more bullish both 
[unintelligible] as to real output for the four or six quarters than had been the Board™s staff.  I 
think we were more confirmed in that view, and 
I have been hesitant to even use the numbers 
4/20/76 - 12 - 
    that we have been developing, but now that we are looking at the year 1976 over 1975, we are on the order of real growth at a 7-1/2 [percent] rate rather than a 6 percent rate, which is what the 
Board has on a year-over-year basis.   I had not heard the kind of comments that W
illis Winn just reported to us about shortages 
and allocation, but I do think that the expectation is of a pick-up around the world, not just in the United States.  The signs are coming in of greater 
strength in Europe and Japan.  And while it is too soon to talk about a cumulative boom, I think th
at there™s a greater risk that we will be facing boom conditions by this time in ™77 than 
that there will be any petering out. 
MR. BALLES.  I would like to ask Lyle a question.  I understand that some of the 
congressional committees have been doing the sort of alternative money growth assumptions that 

you have in terms of effects on the economy.  Do
 you have any idea how their results come out 
compared with yours?  Are they using essentially
 different models?  What
 can you tell us about that? MR. GRAMLEY.  I have not studied their resu
lts in comparison with ours closely enough 
to give you a good answer on that.  Perhaps we o
ught to put out a memo on it and send it around 
to the Committee. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What is your guess? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  My guess is that the result
s of [money growth] alternatives on other 
models would show less difference in nomina
l GNP.  We tend to have quite high money 
multipliers in our model relative to other models
.  So I think what you would find is that a 1 percent increase in M1 or a 1 percent decrease would have less effect on nominal GNP on, say, 
the DRI model or the Chase econometrics model 
than it would on ours.  But I would want to look to be sure about that. MR. BALLES.  The only relevance to that obviously is the collected influence [on the] 
thinking of both the staff and the principals, and it would be nice to know what these Congressmen are being told by their staffs. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  We will be happy to send a memo around. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Just a brief comment, largel
y impressionistic.  Of course, it™s against 
a background where we have had pretty good business conditions in the Southwest, but I do not 
hear the claims of expectations of real bullish ch
ange from where we are at the present time.  In 
part, of course, that is because the drilling activity is down significantly.  I understand that there normally is a seasonal decline in 
that activity from the end of the year through the first quarter.  But the decline is more this year than usually oc
curs, and there is a sharp difference of opinion as to whether it™s going to continue or whether it™s going to turn around.  I just want to register that--to some extent--impressionistic feeling, that it is a little different in that part of the world from what I have just heard. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Loan demand has been ve
ry sluggish in the reports.  Numerous 
discussions that I have had recently with small to
 medium-sized country banks suggest to me that 
4/20/76 - 13 - 
    demand is much more vigorous than figures woul
d suggest, and this may be reflecting itself in 
the numbers as they are coming out of the next--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think there has been a difference for some months between the 
larger banks and the smaller 
banks across the country.   MR. AXILROD.  That™s correct, President East
burn.  And we made an analysis of the 
weekly reporting banks vis à vis the others, and things have been much less weak at the 
nonweekly reporters. MR. EASTBURN.  The question has to do with
 productivity.  Our assumption has been fairly bullish on the rate of increase in productivity, which tends to lead to a fairly optimistic 
view as to the impact on wage push and 
so on.  What kind of a figure do you have? MR. GRAMLEY.  After the first quarter, we ar
e assuming an increase of productivity of 
around 3 percent, 2.9 percent.  Our first quarter number was quite low, 
and this is one reason why we feel more comfortable that the numbers
 that Commerce has come up with in GNP are 
now beginning to make more sense given the figure
s we have been looking at in terms of man-
hours.   But a 3 percent increase in productivity is about what you would expect, I think, if the rate of real expansion is 5 to 5-1/4 percent.  If we are in the process 
of revising up [the] rate of real expansion, as I think we will be, this will have
 more optimistic implications for productivity.  
But I think one can™t discount the fact that the economy is stronger.  You really can™t anticipate 
that this improvement in productivity will work th
rough to a lower rate of increase in prices.  
And I think you have to figure that shortage pr
oblems will begin to develop in particular 
industries, and you will ge
t particular price increases, whic
h will mean a more rapid rate of 
increase in the average price level. 
MR. MACLAURY.  John Balles reminded me of
 a question with his question on staff on the Hill.  The news releases from the Senate Budget Committee came out with a more 

expansionary fiscal policy than the President had proposed.  [It was] argued in the press release that this was less inflationary and [provided] more
 real bang for the buck in terms of real growth.  
I think they argued it on the basis that they were not going to have higher payroll taxes, which would in turn be passed directly on in price increases.  I wonder what the staff felt about this line of argument.  Was this a strictly
 political document in that contex
t or was there some truth to it? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me answer that
.  Nothing on Capitol Hill is done by economists.  [It] is strictly polit
ical--it™s just bad economics.   
MR. GRAMLEY.  There™s an element of truth to the argument.  

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There™s an element 
of truth to all things erroneous. MR. GRAMLEY.  If payroll ta
xes are not raised, that is one less [thing] pushing [unintelligible] on the price level.  But if you 
are talking about a more 
expansive fiscal policy generally, other than that element,
 I don™t think you can argue it is going to be less inflationary.  4/20/76 - 14 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  It™s the same ar
gument, isn™t it, that holding down interest rates prevents inflation? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  In a similar fashion, yes. 

MR. WINN.  Dave™s comment on 
the country banks showing a little more strength than the 
city banks reminded me that I wa
s surprised to discover what rapid strides the credit unions had made as a source of consumer credit and the rela
tive proportion of increase that has taken place in their status as a supplier in this area.  It™s the most striking change of all the groups. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, it™s growing very rapidly. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think we have gone as far as we usefully can at this point in our discussion of the economic outlook.  Let™s turn to
 Mr. Sternlight™s report on operations at the Domestic [Trading] Desk.   
MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Secretary's note: Th
is statement was not found in Committee 
records.] 
CHNAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much.  
In the future it would be desirable to submit to the Committee before the meeting a repor
t of how the Desk might have operated under 
the criteria on nonborrowed reserves.  Now, you mi
ght do it at the meeting as well.  But I found 
the latter part of your report extremely difficult to
 follow.  And I am not sure that I would have 
grasped it if I had had the report in advance, but I would have had the opportunity to study it. MR. STERNLIGHT.  But we have put indications in our weekly reports and the report that 
covers the four-week period ending last Wednesday. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™ve done that?  We
ll, I™m sorry, I just haven™t read that. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  It is perhaps not as easy to follow there, where we are all charting 
our way through unfamiliar territory, and we w
ill try to improve th
e [unintelligible]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I just had some difficu
lty following the last part of your report, and I don™t know whether others did.  I may not 
be sufficiently awake this morning. Yes, Mr. 
Coldwell. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Peter, has the market reac
ted, or does it know of a change in our 
acceptance [unintelligible]? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  No, I™ve seen no comment fr
om the market on that at all.  I don™t 
believe they are really aware of it. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Second question.  Do you s
ee any signs of a longer range--I don™t mean in the immediate weeks ahead, but longer 
than that--decline in corporate bond offerings? MR. STERNLIGHT.  [From our talking] to th
e underwriting houses that seek to make 
estimates of what™s coming, I think there™s a genera
l feeling in the market 
that the volume will be 
4/20/76 - 15 - 
    tapering off as the year goes along.  I think there was a feeling a few months ago that there 
would be an even sharper drop than has transpired, but there is still a feeling that it will decline 
as we go along this year. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Black. 

MR. BLACK.  Peter, you mentioned in your
 discussion of what would have happened under a nonborrowed target that we did run into a problem with 
overly narrow constraints on the federal funds rate movements, which we mi
ght have expected.  Did you see any other mechanical difficulties that you thought the Desk 
would encounter if we 
were in fact operating 
on such a target? MR. STERNLIGHT.  I wouldn™t describe them 
as mechanical difficulties, no.  But I did 
point out that we would have been led to a firmer stance in the provision of reserves even 
though, through most of the period until the last fe
w days, it looked as though monetary growth 
was pretty much close to its midpoint.  So ha
d we been looking through the nonborrowed guide, we would not have wanted to have a firmer federal funds rate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Kimbrel, please. 

MR. KIMBREL.  Moving back to the acceptances, Peter, were these reductions 
accomplished altogether in maturities? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Yes, we did not sell any.  What we have been doing is reducing our 
pace of buying so that we don™t cove
r the maturing amounts week by week. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Mr. Chairman, may I just sa
y that Peter™s playing ﬁwhat might have 
beenﬂ is a hard game, and I thought you made a valia
nt effort to try to relive that span with another life.  I think as you keep at it and put it down, it ma
y fall into a better shape.   
I would say I believe it™s going to [require] looking back over more than one episode, 
probably several episodes in a row.  Then we will 
begin to see whether, on balance, that world of 
ﬁwhat might have beenﬂ has a real meaningful attr
action to the Committee.  One of the things it™s 
bound to produce are [periods] when one of our specifications or one of our instruments is a bit 
out of sync with the others, that™s one of the things that evidence has made 
very clear, and I think it will take several episodes to put it in the proper perspective. 
MR. MACLAURY.  But as you extend your experime
nt in that fashion, it gets increasingly hard to say what might have been because you star
t with a base and you get a little further away 
from it unless you are taking one-month chunks.  But 
to know after five months of experiment 
where you would have been--I think it is relatively easy with one month and relatively more 
difficult as you expand that experiment. SPEAKER(?).  The more diffi
cult the more important. 
SPEAKER(?).  He has to keep track of-- 
4/20/76 - 16 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  My guess would be that it ought to be done in one-month chunks; 
otherwise you would be piling assumption on assumption--you wouldn™t begin to know where 
you are.  I think you can learn some
thing, if, let us say, we do this for six months.  At the end of 
the six months, using the cumulative evidence of
 the one month™s chunks
, [we might conclude] 
that we would have done better had we relied on nonborrowed reserves to a larger extent.   Well, that would affect our judgment with regard
 to the future.  But, of course, it might be 
better with that scheme for six months and then
 do more poorly in the next six months--that™s 
something else again, but that is the risk
 that goes with whatever we may do.   
I would like to ask one question.  If you had operated on nonborrowed reserves, do you think that, considering the objectives of our monetary policy, whic
h I am not going to define at 
the moment-- I™ll let you define
 it in your own way, and don™t do it out loud, please--do you think that you would have done better than we have done during the past month?  Do you have a 
view on that? MR. STERNLIGHT.  I am not convinced th
at we could have done better.  No. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, there is a prob
lem defining what is better and what is 
worse, it seems to me, without criter
ia as to what you are trying to do. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we will get a long discussion if we pursue that thought.  
Obviously, no matter what we do, we are not doing 
these exercises for their own sake.  We are 
going through these exercises in the interest of the re
al economy as far as employment goes, 
production goes, and the price level. MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, my question 
has been answered by this discussion. 
MR. PARTEE.  I was simply going to say that I  thought this first m
onth was a telling kind of experiment because, if I understand it, M1 an
d M2 were right on target, very close to the 
midpoint.  There was, in a sense, a mechan
ical problem and its specification on nonborrowed 
reserves, that is to say, the multiplier, changed a li
ttle bit.  So you would have had to have raised 
the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point by the end of the period, even more if you hadn™t 
been following a rule on constraint, even though the M1 and M2 figures were quite good.  I think you do ask whether there was a mechanical proble
m here in the sense of specification of the 
multiplier that would have resulted in a disse
rvice to the [unintelligible] had you used the 
nonborrowed target. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Or this might look a 
little different six m
onths from now.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Or 
it might look different next month or it might be just 
what the doctor ordered. MR. PARTEE.  No, I don™t think that™s fair. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The money suppl
y increasing both the target rate--  
4/20/76 - 17 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  No, I™m simply talking about 
the fact that nonborrowed reserves ran high relative to the observed money numbers.  Now that has nothing to do with the dynamics of the situation.  That has to do with the 
specifications of the relationship. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Th
ere is a question of a lag here, and the money supply 
has been running a little high in the last couple of weeks. MR. PARTEE.  But the lag goes the other wa
y, because there are 
[unintelligible] two 
weeks left. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Take the end result, the rising federal funds rate--six months from 
now that might look awfully good to us. 
MR. PARTEE.  But that would simply be luck
 if that happened.  There is nothing in the observation of that relationship that would lead to that conclusion.  It would just be luck. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s a [unintelligible] to be on the side of luck. 

MR. AXILROD.  Governor Partee, it™s not 
entirely beyond the projection period because we did have more strength in M1 in the week of April 7, for example, 
which is affecting our required reserves in the week of April 21.  That™s one of the week
s that™s throwing Mr. Sternlight off his path. MR. PARTEE.  I see. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  To elabor
ate on that point, if we™re 
to say, we ignore zones of 
tolerance, and if we attempted fine tuning under our present scheme
, I think the Desk would have been raising the federal funds rate a week or so before [unintelligible]. SPEAKER(?).  Very recently, very recen
tly.  But not the most [unintelligible]
 period. MR. AXILROD.  As a matter of fact, for most 
of the five-week period, Mr. Sternlight and I were carrying on a conversation of what you would really do if you had nonborrowed reserves, and we were debating whether you would raise it earl
y or wait.  And that was the nature of the debate, and if you are actually on a nonborrowed reserve target for an average period, that is innate in that the Desk always has the option as to whether to operate early or late. SPEAKER(?).  Maybe your estimate of nonborrowed was just wrong. 
SPEAKER(?).  That™s possible. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think we™v
e entered the wrong possibilities.  MR. JACKSON.  My only comment was, if you had gone ahead and operated on a strict basis as the Chairman mentioned, then the dispar
ity between the results 
you did achieve and the results you might have achieved would have been na
rrow.  So perhaps you weren™t off as far as it 
might initially appear. 
4/20/76 - 18 - 
    MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think that™s right.  As I mentioned, we think we came out about 
$90 million above, but had we been on the target
ing basis we would have come out say $40 
million above on nonborrowed [reserves] but with 
a concomitant firming of the money market. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me ask you this ques
tion.  In operating through this simulation exercise on nonborrowed reserves, did you allow for a zone of tolerance, if my question makes 
any sense?  What I am trying to say is th
at the two methods [unintelligible] should be 
comparable, and if one [method] allows for a ra
nge of tolerance, then so should the other. MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, I believe we 
have done some work on the relationships 
between the two-month zone of tolerance.  [I
n] this  intermeeting [period, the] nonborrowed 
[reserves] target ] and the plus or minus 
$50 million that the Subcommittee on the Directive 
recommends appear to us to be consistent with
 a zone of indifference of about 2 percentage points on a two-month period. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I would say that, as we were going through this, we were trying to 
envision what nonborrowed number we would ai
m for week by week, and unless we were 
constrained by the federal funds constraint, we would aim for the 
target number.  So, in that 
sense, I think it is a little different from the zone of indifference that we talked about when we are guided by the Ms in setting the federal funds rate
 objective.  I regarded this plus or minus $50 
million range as something that the Committee might
 be indifferent to in assessing whether the 
Desk has [hit] a target or not.   It seems to me as I read the output of the 
Subcommittee on the Direc
tive that they would 
direct us to try to hit a nonborrowed number, but
 a $50 million [deviation on] either side of that 
would be regarded as essentially hitting that number.  They were not telling us to keep money market conditions unchanged as long as it l
ooks as though you come within $50 million of the 
center of the range. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think there™s a technical point here that we ought not to try to unravel.  It does seem to me that there ma
y be a flaw in the comparison.  That kind of 
hypothetical exercise could logically be compared
 with the method that we have been operating 
under without the zone of indifference.  Engaging in [unintelligible]. SPEAKER(?).  I think that™s right. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think this is somethi
ng that members of the staff ought to discuss 
and perhaps revise the estimating procedure 
that you engaged in.  Or you might reach the 
decision that you are just going to try.  But I don™t think we ought to pursue that here any further.  Any other questions?  Thank you Mr. Sternlight.  
A motion to confirm the transactions of the 
Domestic Desk will now be in order. 
SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

SPEAKER(?).  Seconded. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We want to turn now to our longer-run targets, and I want to say something on the subject before we turn to a discussion.   
4/20/76 - 19 - 
    As I believe the members of the Committee 
know, we must testify once again on the 
subject, and the testimony is now scheduled be
fore the Senate Banking Committee on May 3.  At 
that time we will need to announce our prospectiv
e monetary ranges for the year starting in the 
second quarter of 1976, and we™ll have to reach a decision on that at this meeting.  I™d like to 
review with you some of considerations that will
 bear on our decision as I see it, and I™ll make a 
recommendation to the Committee.  But fi
rst a few words by way of introduction.   
One year has now elapsed since, acting under House Concurrent Resolution 133, we first announced our expected monetary ranges.  Looking back over the past year, we™ve come rather 
close to the monetary ranges that we announced last year.  Between March of 1975 and March of this year, M1 grew by 5 percent, [whereas] our announced range for M1 was 5 to 7-1/2 percent; M2 grew by 9.4 percent, and our announced range was 8-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent; and M3 grew by 12.1 percent, and our announced range was 10 to 12 percent.  So, M1 was at the lower end of the range, M3 at the upper end, and M2 close to the middle of the range.  
And therefore a fair conclusion I think would be that we™ve done reasonably well.  We™re meeting our own 
expectations as of a year ago.   That, however--and we must always remind 
ourselves of this--is no cause for self-congratulations.  The congressional resolution recognizes clearly that we, members of this 
Committee, must feel free to modify our goals
 and that we may do so at any time.  The 
congressional resolution recognizes that our objective is and must be the good performance of 
the economy, not the achievement of this or that 
predetermined monetary magnitude.  And if we 
judge ourselves by that criterion, namely, the pe
rformance of the econom
y, as I think we should, we could all take some satisfaction from th
e way in which monetary policy was conducted 
during the past year.   Now another word or two by way of introdu
ction.  Since March 1975, we have changed our monetary ranges to some degree.  Last Octo
ber we reduced the lower limit of M2 from 8-1/2 
to 7-1/2 percent, and at the same time we re
duced the lower limit of M3 from 10 percent to 
9 percent, and this January we made another 
change--we reduced the lo
wer limit of M1 from 
5 percent to 4-1/2 percent.  So during the past year we have made three changes and all in the direction of lowering the lower limit, with the co
nsequence that our ranges have become wider, 
and they were not narrow to begin with.   The question before us is, of course, where do we go from here, and let me comment first 
on M1, which, to my judgment unfortunately, is s
till the monetary magnitude that is followed 
most closely--a fact that we cannot ignore.  There are several considerations, I believe, that point to the desirability of lowering 
our range for growth in M1.  One fact, of course, is that the expansion is now one year old, and we™re looking another year ahead.  Therefore, we are looking 
to a point in time that is two years away from
 the trough of the recession.  One could reasonably argue, and I would, that some m
oderation of monetary stimulus would appear desirable if 
inflationary pressures during the coming year are to be kept under reasonable control.   A second consideration pointing to the desirability for lowering the range [for M1] is that we™ve said all along, often to ourselves and at times to the genera
l public, that our longer-range objective on the price front, looking beyond the [coming] year, is for a return to general price 
stability.  And being in the more advanced stag
e of the expansion, this may well be an opportune 
4/20/76 - 20 - 
    time to take [a] small step toward the goal of re
turning [growth of] our mo
netary aggregates to a 
level that is consistent with general price stability.   
That magnitude is variously estimated and, 
without discussing the matter in any detail, 
we™re well above any such magnitude with the M1
 figure.  Even ignoring changes in financial technology that would be consistent with general price stability, it is probably in the range of 1 to 2 percent and, in my own judgment, closer
 to 1 percent than to 2 percent.   There is still a third reason for lowering the ex
pected range of growth for M1, as follows:  During the past six to nine months, the growth of 
M1 has in fact been even lower than the lower 
limit of our present range for M1, 
and the growth that we™ve had has clearly been sufficient to 
finance a good economic recovery.  So it appears that 
the rate of growth that is needed to finance a good economic recovery has been overestimated, 
and this is the subject that our staff has commented on at some length, and this is a matt
er that we™ve testified on at congressional hearings.   But the arguments do not all point
 in one direction.  I think that several cogent arguments 
can also be advanced for leaving the range of M1 where it now is, or possibly even raising it.  One argument pointing to such a conclusion would 
be that unemployment is still very high, and 
those inflationary pressures perhaps have eroded, and that any lowering of the range for M1 at this time would be premature.   
A second argument that could be advanced to 
support such a conclusion would be that we 
cannot be certain that the demand for M1 will con
tinue to decline relative to GNP or economic 
activity at large, and that a re
versal is in 
fact possible. Still a third argument that coul
d be advanced in favor of leaving the range [for M1] where 
it is or possibly even raising it might well be that
 we™ve experienced low rates of growth of M1 during the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, rates of growth well below our expected range.  We therefore may wish to co
mpensate for the relatively low rates of growth 
in the immediately pr
eceding quarters.   Now these are the considerations, pro and con, as I see them, and there will be others.  On 
balance, as I see this problem, I believe the case
 is stronger for lowering the range of M1 than for leaving it unchanged or raising it, but I also believe that the re
duction should be small, and I 
would suggest to the Committee that we merely re
duce the upper limit of M1.  In other words, 
the range of growth that we announce would be 4-1/2 to 7 percent instead of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, which it is at the present time or which it was when we last made our 
determination.  The change that I suggest, while sm
all, would in my judgment justify and help to 
reinforce the widespread confidence that the Fe
deral Reserve™s monetary policy now enjoys in 
our country.   On the one hand, it would mean that we remain mindful of the need to prevent a 
resurgence of inflation and that we are working gradually, very responsibly, toward a restoration of general price stability.  At the same time, 
the modest change that I recommend would also 
mean that we are willing to tolerate for the next 
year a rate of growth that may be as high as 
7 percent in M1.  This rate of growth is well above anything that we have experienced during the 4/20/76 - 21 - 
    past two years, so I see no reason why, if we announce a range of 4-1/2 to 7, anyone should be concerned about a shortage of money or 
credit developing during the coming year.   
So much for M1.  Now let me turn much more 
briefly to M2.  I would be inclined also to 
lower the upper limit of M2 by, again, 1/2 percen
tage point, and some of the reasoning that I 
have gone through about M1 carries over M2.  But beyond that and more specifically, I would 
point out that experience during the past year indicates that we
 simply have not needed as much 
scope at the upper end of the M2 range as we™ve allowed in our projections.   Turning to M3, there, perhaps a bit paradoxically, I would leave it alone, leave it where it is, for two reasons.  First, in contrast with M2, we have actually used in full the upper end of the range for M3.  In fact, we have exceeded it slightly, but there is another reason that I think deserves some weight.  M3 contains, as you know, 
the deposits of the thrift institutions, and if we lower the range or lower the upper end of the range for M3, that is bound to lead to some 
interpretation and speculation.  People are bound to say, I believe, that we at the Federal Reserve expect the flow of funds to our 
thrift institutions to be reduced  because we expect market 
interest rates to rise, so that incipient for
ces of disintermediation 
would be released.   Now some of our critics, and we have one or
 two in our country, would stop there, but some might go on and say that not on
ly do we expect market interest 
rates to rise but, since we at the Federal Reserve control interest rates, we ar
e planning to make them 
rise.  I would find such 
an interpretation troublesome at a tim
e of tranquility as far as the Federal Reserve is concerned.   So by way of summary I would recommend that
 we announce at the May 3 hearing a range of 4-1/2 to 7 for M1; a range of 7-1/2 to 10 for M2; and a range of 9 to 12, as it now is, for M3.  And I™ve taken longer than I perhaps should have but this is a highly important subject, not an 
easy one, and I thought we might sa
ve time in the end if I ran th
rough some of the major factors 
that bear on our decision, just as I see them.  Now let™s turn 
to a discussion.  Mr. Coldwell. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I am in agr
eement with the thrust of your reduction.  I 
find a couple of points which I™d like to raise as to the position of leaving one end or other unchanged.  Recognizing that there is some sensitiv
ity to the question of the margin [the range 
for the growth of the aggregates], I think that
, over the past year, we™ve had more and more 
questions raised here at the table [as to] the variability of this aggregate data in the short run.   I™m a little bothered about narrowing [the ma
rgin] down.  You™ve pulled M1 from [a range 
of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent to a range of] 4-1/2 to 7, reducing the upper end by 1/2 [percentage point] and narrowing the spread to a 2-1/2 [percentage point] ma
rgin, while leaving M3 at a 3 [percentage point] margin.   
I find myself wondering if we couldn™t just do 
a 1/2 [percentage point] cut on both ends of the spectrum, to go to 4 to 7 on M1 and 7 to 10 on M2, leaving M3 unchanged.  It seems to me 
that the margin question here perhaps goes agains
t the experience we™ve had.  Also, it seems to 
me that, with the changes in the savings deposits,
 we™ve had severe questions about the ability to control M1.  I™m not sure whether that™s worked
 itself out, or will over the coming months, but to 
narrow this margin at a time when you™re raisin
g even further questions about the meaning of the 
aggregate data seems to me somewhat questionable. 
4/20/76 - 22 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell.  Let me comment on the range.  We™ve 
been criticized a bit, and I think really fairly, 
for making the range 3 per
centage points last time, 
though we had our reasons.  We wanted to move 
gradually, that was the main reason, but the fact 
is that in the process of moving gradually, the range was widened.  I think some of us, at least, 
recognize that as a cost that we on balance were prepared to face.  You see, in determining the 
range of growth for M1, I think that we have typi
cally, at least in recent 
months, taken a range of 
4 percentage points.  Is that correct Mr. Holmes, Mr. Sternlight? 
MR. HOLMES.  That™s true. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, if a range of 4 percentage points is proper for a two-month period, then a range of 2-1/2 percentage points is, if anything, on the high side for a full year.  I believe that is a reasona
ble statement.  [Unintelligible] empirical tests that our staff has 
made.  Is that correct, Steve? 
MR. AXILROD.  Yes, that would be right.  The transitory component, the random 
variation so to speak, is considerably less as the time period lengthens. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that™s 
the comment I had.  Mr. Eastburn, and then 
Mr. Wallich. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Well, I like 
this proposal, Mr. Chairman.  I™ve come prepared to 
suggest that [myself], as a matter of fact.  I 
think it moves in a desi
rable direction for two reasons.  One is that it is the direction in whic
h policy should be moving over time as the cycle 
proceeds.  I think if we™ve made
 mistakes, it™s been in moving t
oo precipitously toward the end of the cycle, and I think this would help to remedy that.  
The other reason is that it does move toward 
a narrower range, and as we gain experience with our long-term targets, I think we should be 
trying to move toward narrower ranges.  As for 
M3, I™ve always some difficulty with the idea of ha
ving this included in our exercise at all, and I 
think that maybe one solution to this would be to drop M3 if we could find a convenient way to do that. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That would mean that we
™ve lost all interest in home building.  
That would be a sin.  Mr. Wallich now, please. 
MR. WALLICH.  With respect 
to M1, this would have been my suggestion, too, and I think this is a good way of following up the previous move.  We don™t move dramatically with a 
whole range, we just pull down the [upper] end.  Now comes the second shoe:  Clearly the upper 
end is the more crucial one.  The lower end only reflects the uncertainties about M1.  I think there are many people who might think that, 
as the expansion progresses and the demand 
for credit picks up--i
f not the demand for 
money--we might be pushed to higher growth rates.
  I™ve thought so myself in the past, but the 
experience seems to show that we may be able to
 get away with [unintelligible] moving the rate 
of money growth in one big movement over the 
cycle from what was too high to closer to a 
reasonable rate.   4/20/76 - 23 - 
    I don™t think it is unreasonable to expect this.  The expansion of nominal GNP in our 
forecast is on the order of 10 to 11 percent, so 
we continue to bank on a 
significant increase in 
velocity of M1, [although] not as large as we™ve had in the past.  As far as M2 is concerned we need virtually no increase in velocity there at all, and that™s roughly in line with past experience.  I would think, therefore, we have at least a good chance of making the goal stick, and since they are logical and move in the right dire
ction, I think that™s what we try. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Mayo now, please. 

MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I find 
your reasoning very persuasive.  It™s completely in line 
with my own position.  I would add one other dimension here that we might want to consider, 

and that is that some of the confus
ion with regard to our targets relates to the fact that the base is 
continually changing and being revised and so forth.  We did a few things with the numbers last 
night in working over the idea that maybe we
 would be on sound ground if we went to the fourth-quarter base rather than the first-quarter base and in effect did that on a 15-month period.   
I would give you the way we look at it as a 4 to 7 percent range for M1.  That would be really quite consistent with th
e way alternative B of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 is stated in the Bluebook 
because of the difference in the base.  And we 
would [deflect the criticisms] that I consider 
somewhat petty [of those] critics who say,  ﬁI
t™s too confusing the way you do these changes in goals.ﬂ  Maybe we are on firmer ground if we us
e a fourth-quarter base, which is indeed a bit firmer than our first- quarter base.   
But regardless of that particular point, I would associate myself with Governor Coldwell in 
a desire to keep the 3-point spread.  I think it gives us, again, the flexibility that we need in the pursuance of these goals.  And I think the figures that you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, as the 
results of our first full year of experience, give some weight to the idea 
of continuing a 3 percent spread, so I would go for 4 to 7, 7 to 10, and 9 to 12. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  I just want to comment on your technical point.  I think that the best reading of House Concurrent Resolution 133 is that we are to make 
our projection for a 12-month period.  Now, if you™re not changing the base in a systematic 
way--that is, [you are] looking 12 months ahead, a
nd so you have to take as your base where you happen to be--I think that has two advantages.  Firs
t, I believe it conforms 
best to the language of 
the resolution.  Second, if we deviate from that
 rule, then you can be charged with manipulation, 
and a whole new flood of criticism may come our 
way.  Now, this way, our critics may charge 
that we are stupid, but at least we™re stupid in a consiste
nt way, we™re not manipulating.   
And in this post-Watergate environment, where 
one is so eager to jump to accusations of 
manipulation on anything that even remotely smack
s of that nature, I think we must absolutely 
avoid [anything that] is susceptible to that kind of interpretation.  We
ll, thank you for your suggestion, and now Mr. Kimbrel. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, for a slightly 
different reason, I think I would prefer to see the downside reduced also.  I have not reason
ed out this closing of the spread, but I am 
concerned about the difficult price signals that continue to emanate.  And I guess if we really are meaningful in trying to accomplish some price stab
ility, I™d like to see us gradually move in that 4/20/76 - 24 - 
    direction.  For that reason, I thi
nk I would like to see the 4 to 7 range prevail, with the idea of maybe truly reflecting that, over that period, 
we are trying to accomplish some more price 
stability.  The other ranges, I think, would be satisfactory to me as you suggested. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, thank you Mr. Kimbrel.  Perhaps we might break for coffee 
now, and then return to this subject--  
[Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We™re ready to resume 
our discussion, and let™s hear now from Mr. Gardner. MR. GARDNER.  I have been impressed and pleas
ed with the span of 
this discussion.  I think to me the key fact is that we have to begi
n to change.  The evidence is not here that the 
change is critical or essential, but we all know clearly the beginnings of change have [unintelligible].  If we believe in moderate and stable growth, th
en I think our change should be moderate.   I can easily understand the alternate arguments--unemployment coming down quickly but 
still very high; bank credit, which we [unintelligible] describe as a financing gap, has not occurred.  Earlier in our discussion, we were talking about the financing gap, when what we really are talking about, I guess, is the fact that bank loans haven™t come along at the same rate 
that the economy has.  I think Willis™ comments a
bout the curious dichotomy that exists between 
small-bank loan demand and large-bank loan demand 
is very interesting, but I want to suggest, gentlemen, that when the prime rate moves, it™s 
more likely to be a general and nationwide move 
when it™s done by large banks and not by sma
ll banks.  And the large banks don™t have a significant loan demand.   
But the point I really am impressed with is 
that it™s time for the beginning of a change.  
And in that sense I am impressed 
with the idea that we narrow the target to some extent--that we 
knock a small [amount] off the top of the range 
and that we not continue the full range by lowering both the lower end of the range and the high end of the range.  I think that™s useful psychologically and significant and consistent with the position we find ourselves in today.   You know, I have no trouble at all rationalizing leaving M3 with a wider range, and the reason is that we all get somewhat dismayed a
bout the housing industry, which is what the thrift industry equals, having enormous force.  But the 
key fact is that housing is an extremely large 
and important industry, and its reco
very at the price levels that are now going in to the average home is still a very questionable ma
rk in my mind.  I think it™s ju
st fine that there is an ample 
flow of credit for housing, and so I have no trouble rationalizing leaving M3 in the current position that it is in today.   
It™s time to begin to take recognition of the 
factors that we know must change, and I would 
vote strongly for the very modera
te proposal that, in my view, 
the Chairman has made.  Thank 
you. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner.  Mr. Jackson now, please. 4/20/76 - 25 - 
    MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I share mo
st of Governor Gardner™s comments in general.  However, I do share some comments by 
Mr. Kimbrel concerning the price situation.  I 
think we™ll have to face this.  I™m inclined to 
think that our posture should not only recognize 
that we would find intolerable a larger range of growth, which the reduction of upper limits 
would do, but I think that it might be equally 
appropriate, perhaps, for the public to clearly understand that we would find equally tolerable a slower rate of growth.  And for that reason I would be inclined to go ahead and drop the lower limits about 1/2 point as well as drop the upper 
limits about 1/2 point.   
However when it comes to M3, I think the 9 to
 12 range is probably reasonable.  If you look at the actual rates of growth on that narrow portion of the difference between M2 and M3 [unintelligible].  But I believe the consequences of the broad action would bring those into the 9 to 12 range, which would be a significant reduction from their present posture and probably 
would be an appropriate action just to leave it right where it is. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Partee now, please. MR. PARTEE.  Mr. Chairman, I™m prepar
ed to accept your recommendation for the 
specification of the long-range rates of growth, but I think that I would like to make a couple of 
observations about it to rather qualify my support.  First, I thin
k that the real GNP growth over the next five quarters as projected by the staff is intolerably low.  I don™t really believe that we could in good conscience lower our growth rate targets for the monetary aggregates if we 
thought that real GNP was going to increase only at a 5 percent annual rate--that would mean 
very, very little progress in reducing unemployment over that five qua
rters, and it would be a rate of growth that would be rather poor by historical comparison.  Now, I think it™s going to be 
higher than that.  I guess I would expect somethin
g like Paul™s 6 percent rate of growth.  I would be surprised if it was as high as 7-1/2, Bruce, but it could maybe be that high. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Your figure of 7-1/2 percent was a year-over-year comparison. 
MR. MACLAURY.  A year-over-year fi
gure rather than the quarterly-- 
MR. PARTEE.  ™76 over ™75? MR. MACLAURY.  Right. 

MR. PARTEE.  Well, even so, that™s a pretty 
. . . well, I guess that™s probably more like 7 
on a quarterly basis. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Could be lower. 
MR. PARTEE.  And I don™t know that it will be th
at high, but I want to make it clear that I 
would support the slight lowering in the growth ranges in the expectation that economic growth would be a good deal better than 5 percent.   I don™t know any more what rate of monetary ex
pansion is consistent with that rate of 
economic growth.  I don™t think we have really 
any basis [on which to proceed in specifying] that, and so it seems to me possible that we™re 
specifying a rate of monetary growth that™s too 
4/20/76 - 26 - 
    low for good continued economic recovery.  But I th
ink I would have to see signs that it was too low, in other words, developing problems in th
e market.  Today we don™t have those problems.  
We have very good savings inflows, credit is comfor
tably available, and interest rates are still, if anything, inching downward, and therefore we certainly don™t have signs of monetary constraint 
on the economy at this time.  So
 that™s my first comment.   
My second comment is that I think that the 
Committee has to recognize that there™s a very 
good possibility that it will overshoot the top end of 
its yearly ranges in the second quarter.  That 
is the very first quarter coming up.  Now the 
staff midpoint projection 
for the second quarter average is, I believe, about 7 percent on M1, and it™s also at the upper end of the range on M2.  So there is a good possibility that in this second quarter, on average from the first quarter, we 
will exceed the upper limits of the long-term growth ranges that we™re
 just now about to specify.   
I don™t see that as a great problem.  We™v
e had two quarters in which we™ve fallen considerably short of the lower end of those ranges, and I think that we ought to be prepared to support, or at least not move t
oo strongly against, a tendency to overshoot in the coming quarter.  
I think that™s the way that one can justify changi
ng the base [unintelligible] and yet regard the 
thing with enough looseness that you™re prepared to see an undershoot or an overshoot.  We may 
well have an overshoot coming up.  But I would not be
 prepared in the immediate future to move 
strongly upward in interest rates in order to try to bring the aggregates in the short run down into these growth ranges that we™re specifying.  So those are the two reservations I wanted to convey.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee.  Mr. Black now, please. MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I think the rang
es you™ve suggested are the best possible ones, and I™d just like to point out one little point that I don™t think has been developed.  We 
lowered the upper limits to show our concern for 
inflation, and I share Governor Partee™s feeling that the economy is much stronger than has been 
projected by the staff.  I think you can make a 
case for lowering the lower limits, but in the face of
 [current levels of] unemployment, I think it 
would be unwise to do that now.  I think we want to continue to show the markets we™ve got a 
concern for unemployment, so I™d leave those rate
s there.  But secretly I would hope that we move down toward the lower end of it in our long-run targets. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Holland now, please.   MR. HOLLAND.  Well, I think that over this past year the Committee and the Chairman 
have converted these long-range target ranges--which we [resisted] a bit when they first got introduced--into an extraordinarily helpful communi
cations device, certainly to the public and even occasionally to ourselves.  And I think this 
is one of those occasions when they can serve 
that kind of purpose.   I think it™s time to work down the upper end of th
ose ranges a bit.  I believe this is a time, 
monetarily, for a sort of a stitch-in-time action on the part of the FOMC because economic 
activity is moving up now into new high ground.  And we need to begin to try to adjust to a further gradual reduction in unemployment and hopefully gra
dually further iron out that inflationary bulge.  I don™t think we ought 
to aspire to accommodate the usual cyclical 
4/20/76 - 27 - 
    expansion.  We™re still, I believe, afflicted with mo
re fundamental problems that we need to keep 
working away at, and it seems to me that workin
g down the top end of the ranges for M1 and M2 makes good sense.   
I could be talked into working down the top end of the range for M3, but I think there™s a good case for leaving it there as well.  And I point out to you that we do have also a long-range target, I think, in the credit proxy, and we aren™t lowering that either.  Now, there™s a similarity 
here that™s saying, in effect, that the big difference between a credit proxy and M2 is big CDs at commercial banks.  S&Ls don™t have any big CDs.   So what, in effect, we™re suggesting with the credit proxy staying unchanged, as I think it should, and M3 staying unchanged is that we expect the total liabilities of both the banking system and the nonbank thrift institutions to conti
nue to rise in about the range we™ve specified before.  And I think there™s a little harmony in th
at it has an economic logic all its own.  If we 
start to get some other kind of fi
rming in credit demand that the st
aff expects, I think that we™ll probably see a little bit of life come up in big CD
 expansion, and that will at the same time make 
banks a little more acqui
escent in a touch softer performance 
in their other M2 liabilities.   
I™d like to see the ranges narrowed.  I think we widened them when we were uncertain, but 
I think on balance it makes sense for them to be 
a little narrower.  This 
is always a sort of balancing act between making them wide enough 
so we don™t ever get caught off base and making them narrow enough to be reasonable targets.  And it seems to me [that making them] a 

bit narrower than we now have is a good idea.   Finally, I should just as a grace note say 
I like what I heard Chuck say about the relationship of second-quarter projections to year[-long] projections.  I think that™s just the right way to look at it.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Holland.  I™d like to say a word about the credit proxy.  I didn™t comment on that at all.  I ma
de no recommendation to the Committee because I 
didn™t have enough time to study the matter, and I th
ink it™s a difficult question.  We™ve been so 
wide of the mark in the credit proxy that even 
the continuance of it is somewhat in doubt, and 
that opinion has been expressed around this table.  The main reason for continuing with the 
credit proxy is that we want to indicate to the congressional 
committee and to the general public 
that we™re not only concerned with the money suppl
y but also with the amount of credit that is extended by the banking system.   
Now I would suggest that we handle the credit proxy as follows.  After we reach our 
decision about the three Ms, let our staff go to work on that and make its recommendation.  And 
then a subcommittee of this Committee--perhaps 
consisting of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman 
of this Committee, and Mr. Gardner--could work w
ith the staff and then accept or modify [the 
staff recommendation] on behalf of the Committ
ee.  We™ll discuss th
is proposal later on.  Because you may be right, Mr. Ho
lland, saying we ought to leave it. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I think I am.  In pouring ove
r the numbers, I think 
that™s the right way to come out. 
4/20/76 - 28 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™ve studied it.  I haven™t studied it, and I would hesitate really to go one way or another without listening to the staff and doing a bit of work myself on the 
subject.  We™ll come back to that.  I™m glad
 you have studied it, and if we proceed by the subcommittee device, let™s have at least one 
member of this Committee who has studied the 
matter, and that means you, Mr. Holland. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I don™t think you™d better, Mr. 
Chairman.  I think I™d better pass.  I™ll 
gladly pass on my information to the staff, and you can consume it indirectly. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you will be in a pe
riod of grace over the next two days, I™m 
sure, and our staff will get that under way.  No, I 
don™t want to lose this knowledge that you™ve 
accumulated. 
MR. BLACK.  I think he™s got a short-run attitude, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Volcker. 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just following up on your suggestion of a subcommittee 
here.  Do you contemplate it would be [within] the jurisdiction of that subcommittee not to have 

the credit proxy at all or do you think that we™re--  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I don™t think that should be--I think we must all suffer. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That may be indicative of the amount of study that I™ve 
given to the credit proxy.   But on the general question [of the ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates], obviously very persuasive reasons have been suggested around the table already, which I share, for lowering these ranges.  Indeed, for M1 at least, I came to the meeting prepared to raise the 
question, but not to press the question, of lowering them by more 
than 1/2 [percentage point], largely on the grounds that when one looks at this in a perspective over a period of time, as you 
did, Mr. Chairman, in your introductory remarks, and if you assume that you would like to get 

down to 1 or 2 percent eventually, and you go at the rate of 1/2 [percentage point] a year, which is what™s implied here, it takes a hell of a long time to get there.  And it may raise some question 
of the conviction with which we pursue that prospect.  I do indeed think you could make a case 
for 1 [percentage point] a year quite reasonably, but 
I will not belabor it because it™s an extension 
of the arguments that you use.   I also came prepared to quite happily s
upport a 1/2 [percentage point] reduction as an appropriate move at this particular point in time.  That would ev
en include just 1/2 percent[age point] on the upper ranges, as you suggested, because it seems to me the upper end of the ranges, 
as a number of people have suggested, is the mo
re significant figure here and the figure that people will look at as to what we
™re willing to tolerate in some 
sense.  That™s of the greatest value, but I would be happier to be placed on th
e side of those who think on balance it would be better to reduce it both at the upper end of the range and the lower end of the range, both for the substantive reasons that have been suggested and the fact that I™d like to keep the range a little wider than a little narrower.   
4/20/76 - 29 - 
    On M3, it seems to me that you can make a ve
ry good technical argument.  But consistent 
with those kinds of decisions, the thing should remain about where it is, and we just track our 
past performance.  It seems to make sense if 
we™re going to meet both targets at the same time, 
judging from what has happened.  My only concern th
ere is I™m a little bit 
restive about some of 
your rationale, Mr. Chairman, because it seems to promise conceivably that you would be 

trapped if interest rates did begin rising at some
 point and we began failing to meet the range on 
M3--which one do you look at?  Which one do we real
ly think is more significant?  And if we™re 
too afraid to reduce the M3 range when it seems appropriate, whic
h I don™t argue is necessarily 
[the case] this time, we 
could be in trouble.   So I would just put a little footnote on keeping that one unchanged, which does seem to me 
appropriate for this particular quarter.  But maybe it is something 
we want to look at next quarter in the light of what is then going on and what the interest rate developmen
ts have been and what their prospects might be in the coming period.  In 
fact, that one also looks unsustainably high to me over a longer period of time, and we ought to 
be thinking about when and where it should be reduced.  So my acquiescence in th
at which I think is correct and [unintelligible] but strongly support is perhaps [of only a] limited time duration. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well that™s all that we™r
e concerned about [unintelligible] waiting.  
Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Mr. Balles now, please. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I™d like to say ju
st a few words about the first of the three reasons that you cited for a mode
st reduction in the upper limit 
of the ranges of M1 and M2, namely, the fact that we™ve got to be alert to 
the dangers of renewed inflation.  This has to do with what happened back in that period of 1971 to ™73, when one major industrial country abroad 

really had an explosion in money supplies, which 
I think [played] a big part in world inflation 
and also [unintelligible] very severely, in my opi
nion, in the United States in terms of the prices 
of internationally traded commodities.   
As I looked at what™s going on in 10 major [for
eign] countries, I was very surprised to find out that, [although we] tightened up on our rates of monetary growth
 since ™73-™74, six of the 10 leading countries now have rates of [monetary] 
growth for the ™74-™75 period actually bigger than they did back in the ™71-™73 period.  To me 
that™s a danger signal that we may be setting the 
stage, or that they may be setting stage, for a 
renewal of world inflation, which, if it occurs, will certainly make it very difficult for us in the United
 States to keep our inflation rate as low as 5 percent.   So, for those reasons, I would support a move 
toward lowering these ranges in modest 
steps.  I would be prepared to accept the particular specifications 
that you mentioned.  If I leaned 
in any direction, I think I™d lean in the direction of perhaps adding to what you had to say, pulling down the lower end of the two ranges on M1
 and M2 by 1/2 point as well.  If we don™t do that now, I think we can take a look at it in another three months
, but I would certainly support at least pulling down the upper end of the range. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. MacLaury now, please. 4/20/76 - 30 - 
    MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I 
certainly support your suggestions as to the ranges.  I came prepared to argue for a 4 to 7 
percent, in other words, a 1/2 [percentage point] 
down on both sides of M1 and M2--it does really ma
tter.  But my conviction that we ought to be working with narrower ranges rather than wider 
ranges makes me very content to accept a one-
sided reduction this time around.   
I also agree with Chuck Partee™s first reservation, in particular, namely, that we should be 
doing this in the belief that the Greenbook forecast is too low, and I subscribe to that idea too.   A couple of points on your reasons, which you 
may or may not have a [unintelligible] of, 
and you may or may not use with the Congress it
self in your testimony.  It seems to me we 
should be leery of accepting the argument you cited 
on the con side, that we can afford sustained 
rapid growth now because we have some catchin
g up to do.  I™m reluctant to give credence to 
that kind of an argument, and specifically because 
I believe that our forecasts, our expectations 
today, have built into them whatever has happene
d in the past.  And we are looking at a GNP 
forecast predicated on those factors having been
 built in, so there™s 
no case therefore for 
compensating today for what has already transpired.   
And the other point, just to strengthen perhaps or add a different angle to one of your pros:  It seems to me that the kind of range that we™re
 talking about today is a very different number 
than the same number that we adduced a 
year ago because our expectations of--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m sorry, would you 
mind, I want to follow your argument-- 
MR. MACLAURY.  I didn™t say it very well.  Wh
at I had in mind is th
at our expectations for inflation in the year ahead are lower than our expectations were when we first announced 
these targets back in March of 1975; that 6 percent today is not the same 
6 percent as it was a year ago; and that we have a very legitimate case 
for saying that we can finance as much or more 
real growth today with the kind of numbers that we are talking than we could have last year.  I think that™s an important rationale
 for now trying to capture some
 of that advantage that we™ve already gotten in the way of reduced inflation. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, I [uninte
lligible], and he knows why.  Thank you very 
much, Mr. MacLaury.  Anyone else like to speak?  Yes, Mr. Morris.   
MR. MORRIS.  I can support the figures that you gave to us, Mr. Chairman, but I™m a little 
disturbed about the procedure that we™re using in
 establishing our long-term goals.  What we™re doing is making modest changes in the growth ra
nges, superimposing those modest changes on a 
very volatile base number of the base period with
out really giving any elaborate consideration to the effect of this over a long period of time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  By a longer period of time you mean what? 
MR. MORRIS.  A period of say two to three years--how is this adding up over a longer span?  In the present instance, we™re using as a 
base a period in which M2 grew very rapidly and M1 grew very slowly.  I think, in that sense, you might argue th
at the ranges we™re presenting here are more conservative for M1 than for M2.   
4/20/76 - 31 - 
    The other thing that bothers me is that we™re not giving any [unintelligible] consideration 
to the compatibility of our current one-year pr
ojection with those that we had given to the Congress in earlier periods.  In other words, how consistent is this set of numbers with a set of 
numbers which we gave to the Congress three mont
hs and six months ago?  Are we going to run into instances of serious incompatibility?  I think 
it™s possible that, in fact, it could well happen in the future and that therefore it seems to me
 we need a little more staff input in making-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You speak of incompatibility, you mean what? 
MR. MORRIS.  Well, I think in 
[unintelligible] situation, for example, whereas if we were 
going to make both the projections
--the long-run target we put out six months ago and the long-
run target we are publishing today
--if we™re going to make both of these, we would have to have 
the kind of policy changes that we wouldn™t think would make sense. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I understand that, that™s why I asked you a question.  But I 
honestly think that that would put us on the wrong track because then our objective at this table would be to make some predetermined set of num
bers come true, and that must never be our 
objective.  It™s not required by the Congress.  Our objective is the economy, not some set of 
numbers that we dream up at this table.   
And you talked about our procedures.  Well, I 
think there™s some point
 to your criticism, but we might have gone into a deeper discussi
on than we have, you see.  But I don™t think the incompatibility should worry us at all.  If we
™re getting good results in the economy, what else 
do we need?  Suppose, let us say, that our monetary
 growth figures turn out to be 1 percent for M1 and 5 percent for M2 and 6 percent for M3 but that employment was rising, and production 
was rising, and the price level is no longer rising as fast as it had been, and interest rates are fairly stable?  Well, we ought to be quite cont
ent with those monetary growth rates even though they depart, and depart materially, fr
om figures that we had projected. 
MR. MORRIS.  I™m not arguing that the Co
mmittee would necessar
ily come up with a 
different judgment on the numbers, but it seems to 
me that this is input that the Committee ought 
to have.  That we ought to know the relationship between what we™re doing today and what we [unintelligible] for earlier periods.  That doesn™t mean that 
we™d necessarily come up with a 
different judgment.  It does seem to me that this
 is a part of the information process that we don™t have. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you™ve answered your own question.  That is to say that you™ve come out with the judgment, apparently, th
at was close to that of the Committee, even 
though you™ve considered the questions that have not been, in your judgment--and I agree with you--been talked about sufficiently at this table.  And I suppose part of the answer to the procedural question might be to have the staff 
elucidate some of these magnitudes and relations more fully than has been done, but I suspect that what you describe as a defect in procedure may 
be that only to a limited degree.   
If every one of us does his homework--tim
e is limited, so we don™t go through the full process of reasoning that leads us to a conclusi
on because we all speak rather briefly--I™m an 
exception to that, I talk too much.  Thanks
 very much, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Winn please. 
4/20/76 - 32 - 
    MR. WINN.  I concur in your
 recommendations, Mr. Chairman.  And I am thankful, at 
least psychologically as well as economically, that you 
are required to do this every three months 
because I think the scenario that we™ve outlined here
 on 4(a) and (b) is not 
likely to be very real 
in the light of the changes in 
the underlying assumptions.  I think we may have more problems 
down the road to meet this in terms of rates than
 we realize at the present time.  Psychologically I 
think it™s bright news as well [unintelligible].  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Winn.  Anyone else? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I just
 register concurrence with your recommendation.  I think it™s qu
ite appropriate in the circumstances.  I think the maximum 
numbers we have here are still ad
equate to finance quite a substantial inflation, but the fact that we have the maximums doesn™t mean that we will ne
cessarily rise to them, as is demonstrated by experience over the past year, so I™m comfortable with the recommendation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Anyone else?   
Well, I think we™ve had a good discussion, and Mr. Broida has kept a record of the thinking conveyed by members of the Committee with
 his usual [unintelligible] care.  I think I 
can summarize by saying that the numbers [I 
presented] originally at the opening of our discussion are favored by a majority of the Co
mmittee, and therefore we now ought to go to a 
formal vote, and we™ll be voting on a range of 4-
1/2 to 7 for M1, 7-1/2 to 10 for M2, and 9 to 12 for M3.   Ah, Mr. Broida--while trained as an economist--has, by the virt
ue of the secretarial duties and the legislation passed by the Congress, become 
an expert attorney as well, and he advised, and I will not give his reasons, that there are strong reasons for not taking a formal vote but 
merely for determining whether or not what I™ve 
stated conveys the consensus of the Committee.  
Let™s have a show of hands on the existence of
 such a consensus of Committee thinking on the 
part of members of the Committee rather than 
a vote on the magnitudes th
at I have decided.   Now, if you want to know the legal reasons a
nd so on, they will be recited with meticulous 
care by Mr. Broida, who will be supported by Mr. O™
Connell, and I will go to sleep while they 
talk, and the rest of you can do as you please. MR. COLDWELL.  Just one question Mr. Chairman, if this is a formal action of the 
Committee to set longer-range targets, then I wo
uld think that the vote is desirable.  I don™t understand why you don™t have a vote on a target. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t really understand, either.  But since I think it will make no 
difference whether we proceed one way or the ot
her, and since I™m advised by learned counsel 
that there are good reasons for proceeding by the consensus route rather than by strict voting, that is my--I just accept that.  But if you want to
 know the reason--Art is eager, look at the way 
he™s sitting.  [Unintelligible], 
just itching to do that, give you a 
full learned explanation.  He can 
do it in one minute.  Go ahead, Art. 
MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, thus far the 
Committee has not chosen to consider the 
longer-run targets as a formal policy action.  This 
originated in the inclination not to publish the 4/20/76 - 33 - 
    longer run--originally not the longer-run or the short-run targets.  If it were a policy action, they would have always been published.  For a long time--until December 1973--we didn™t publish 

the short run.  Until April ™75, we didn™t publish the long run. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But I don™t understand, we do publish-- MR. BROIDA.  At any time the Committee desi
res, it can make these a formal policy 
action, in which case we will publish them as
 formal votes and show them in the 
Federal Register, which we have not done but which is required for formal policy actions.  They publish 
the directive in the 
Federal Register, so we could agree to publish both the long-run and the short-run targets in the 
Federal Register
 also. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now we better hear from a man who has a law degree and years of 
training practice.  Mr. O™Connell. MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, Art has correc
tly stated the premise on which we have 
chosen, on recommendation, not to take a formal
 vote on longer-term ranges.  They have not 
been considered a matter of Co
mmittee position in policy actions. 
 Thus, that is why Art is urging that it be in the form of a consensu
s rather than a voted action by the Committee. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me ask this questi
on.  Suppose we decided to take a vote, a formal vote, which is the route I was going to fo
llow.  What terrible consequences might follow, 
if any? MR. PARTEE.  You could have dissents and reasons for dissents.  That™s the only thing I can see. 
MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, I think the c
onsequences would be only good.  In fact, it was felt for a long time that the Committee would 
be in a much better position if these were 
formal policy actions. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Well, may I ju
st interject one more--I agree we ought to get to where we™re publishing them, but I believe it wouldn™t 
be a good idea for the Committee to simply vote 
on them today and put them out in the form [in wh
ich they appear] in that specification sheet.   I believe the right vehicle for conveying these in public form is to fold them into the 
language of the directive, and I assume that most members of th
e Committee would like to see 
how they would appear, folded into that directive, before they decided to do it.  I make that 
suggestion for two reasons:  One, I believe it™s only when you wrap a few words around those 

numbers that they have some
 of the protection that--  MR. PARTEE.  They™re in the Record of Policy Actions, you know. MR. HOLLAND.  Well, Chuck, I™ll come to that in a minute.  I™m trying to think now 
about the specification sheet.  The specification sheet is not a good vehicle for release in my 
judgment because it™s too bold, it™s too bald.  
They are simply numbers and have none of the 
qualifications around them that appear in the language that is used in the Record of Policy Actions entry.  However, you could pick up the language in the policy record entry that is now 4/20/76 - 34 - 
    used there, marry it right with 
the directive.  The staff has already done experiments in that 
fashion and produced, I think, an acceptable kind of version.   Now, the reason against voting and then just telling the staff to put them into the policy 
record entry is, I believe, a reason that looks fo
rward to the kinds of pressure this Committee 
may be under from courts and from the citizenry
 in terms of making information available.  
Formal vote information may indeed be pried out 
of you at some stage sooner than the reasons.  
And it is the development of the reasons and the 
background that make the 
policy record late--in terms of 30 or 45 days, whatever
 the Committee decides to do.  Th
erefore, it seems to me, the 
Committee would be well advised to adopt these 
numbers in a form where it would not feel 
embarrassed or open to misinterpr
etation if indeed they were pried out of us on the very afternoon of the meeting.  By folding them into
 the Record of Policy Actions, the language would be acceptable. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m just not following you. 
 If they were pried out of us on the afternoon of the meeting--this is on th
e assumption of this court decision? 
MR. HOLLAND.  Yes. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  It could be 
[that] a final order of the court, after appeal, Mr. Chairman, would direct that the portion of the 
total record containing 
these figures be made 
available immediately following the May meeting. 
 The action vote itself would be immediately 
made available and thus deprived of the so-c
alled wrap-around language that Governor Holland has indicated would be compatible. 
MR. COLDWELL.  The only part that Bob™s talk
ing about that makes it compatible is that 
I think we™ve served the Committee well by havi
ng you announce these at your hearings within the Congress, and if a formal vote has a ch
ance of [being] pre-released, I would not--  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That 
would be unfortunate-- MR. COLDWELL.  I think it would be, too. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --because we testif
y before a congressional committee, and 
courtesy alone--and also respect for the oversight function of the Congress--almost dictates that 
the first announcement be made before that committee. 
MR. MAYO.  I thought that was one of the reasons that we didn™t vote in the first place, to give you the announcement effect with the committee and such interpretation as you wish to make between the time of our advising you and th
e time you appear.  Some of these things may 
be better stated in a little different light when you go up.   MR. PARTEE.  But we don™t report now, though, Bob, what our directive, what our specs are. 
MR. MAYO.  No, but I™m thinking again of the point of the possible immediate release. 
4/20/76 - 35 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  Yeah, well, there are lots of considerations.  If you had to have immediate release, that would mean
 releasing your [federal] funds rate range and the short-run specs.  It™s quite a changed ball game if we 
were to do that.  I don™t think we
 were considering doing that when we made this decision back in ™73, or whenever it was. 
MR. MAYO.  No.  But, Chuck, all I™m trying to say is that we felt that that the Chairman 
should have maximum flexibility in
 the preparation of his own statement and discussion with the 
committee.  There may be some of the elements 
in our discussion he would want to emphasize a little differently two weeks from now than he does today. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would be inclined to be guided by our counsel on this issue, and members of the Committee may or may not share that
 view.  What is your advice, Tom?  What is 
your advice to us as of today, without any prejudgment about what we may do or want to do in 
the future? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, in the light 
of, I think, the wisdom of your concern for 
[having the] first statement being made in 
your testimony under [House Concurrent Resolution 
133], and the fact that I fail to find a significant deficiency in the difference between the formal 
vote and seeing the consensus of the Committee [uni
ntelligible] to that committee, I would think, 
Mr. Chairman, that I would still recommend a 
consensus statement by this Committee on the 
ranges rather than a formal vote. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Could I raise one question w
ith counsel?  Is the long-range target a 
segregable fact? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Pardon? 

MR. COLDWELL.  Is the long-range target a segregable fact? MR. O™CONNELL.  It™s my judgment, Govern
or, that the figure itself [unintelligible] 
could be arguably a segregable fact. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would argue otherwise 
because I confine facts to the economy.  
Now the procedure, projections, and so on, expectations--I would not call them facts, but I could 
see how--now, the plaintiff in this case, you see, has argued with our definition on what a fact is.  We [may] have to agree with the plaintiff, and th
is may acquire the honorific status of fact, what 
we do here.  An expectation or a projection may 
become a fact from certain points of view--of 
course it can be described as a fact. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  It™s more than that.  A projection is a policy decision.  
That was the whole purpose--this was to segregate out from the policy 
decision what was fact, and this is certainly a policy decision. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™ll tell you what--let™s not extend the ranges of [unintelligible].  We have advi
ce from our counsel, and we may or may not take it.  I do think 
that this is a question that should be gone into more deeply than 
we™re able really to do at this time around this table.  Now let™s have a show of hands on the recommendation of Mr. 

O™Connell. 4/20/76 - 36 - 
    SPEAKER(?).  [Unintelligible.] 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  For this time, right? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  For this time, Mr. 
O™Connell™s recommendation is accepted, and 
therefore now let™s have a show of hands on the existence of a consensus on the numbers that I 
have recited. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  You™re asking us to vote as a consensus, whether or not we prefer it? SPEAKER(?).  We agree with your judgment th
at there is consensus.  Whether or not you™re part of it-- MR. BROIDA.  I think all members have their hands up. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now we™re ready to turn 
to the current monetary policy, but before 
we do that let™s have a few words from Mr. Axilrod. 
MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Axilrod.  Mr. Axilrod, the Committee sooner or 
later will want to know about the Treasury financing plan. MR. AXILROD.  Yes sir.  The Treasury, Mr. Chairman, is planning to announce its mid-
May refunding on Wednesday, April 28.  About $4 bill
ion of publicly held debt is maturing, and 
I believe the Treasury plans to raise about--well, their plans are obviously indeterminate--it will 
probably raise about $1-1/2 billion to $2 billion in that financing, so that would be a financing on the order of magnitude of $5 billion 
to $6 billion.  The auctions, if 
they are auctions, will be held 
in the first week in May.  Perhaps Mr. Holmes has something to add to that. 
MR. HOLMES.  No, Mr. Chairman, I think that does it. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you very much.  An
y questions to Mr. Axilrod? MR. COLDWELL.  Did I hear you ri
ght, Steve?  They hold their 
auctions the first week of May for a May 28 refunding? MR. AXILROD.  No, mid-May refunding. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mid-May. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, what latitude 
does that leave us, then, for any possible action today that would  continue to be slightly tightening? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I would 
believe that if the Committee were to 
move in that slightly tightening direction, it might 
be desirable to have a slight indication of that in the market before the auction is set, that is, 
before May 3, 4, or 5, in order to be fair to the 
bidders in the auction and also to be fair to the Treasury in setting the terms of the issues. 
4/20/76 - 37 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All ri
ght, any other questions? MR. PARTEE.  When would they set the terms, Steve? 

MR. AXILROD.  Well, that would be April 28. 

MR. PARTEE.  Yeah, that™s the point I want to make. 
MR. AXILROD.  But that™s fairly flexible. 

MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, may I point out,
 though, that the yield auction gives a little more time for things to adjust 
if they should go that route. MR. PARTEE.  Except the coupon. 
MR. HOLMES.  Just the coupon, then the bid come
s later.  So there™s time, there are a few more days than we used to have under the old system. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, we™re ready for our discussion.  Who™d like to speak 
first
?  Well, let me call on Mr. Volcker, then.  Would you like to speak or not? 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  Well, Mr. Chairman we just reached a consensus on the 
longer term.  Since that™s so fresh in our minds, 
I guess we are forced to be consistent, or should be consistent on this immediate decision.  And 
when I looked at what the staff has done here, they set forth some figures that are consistent 
in their way, but it seems to me not the only way 
you can be consistent.  And the implication of
 what they have set forth--based upon some 
projections of uncertain reliability--permit faster 
growth now, with the prospects of substantially 
slower growth later on.  I™m not convinced that
 makes maximum sense fro
m a policy standpoint.  
When I look at some of these figures, I don™t kno
w as I would want the aggregates rising so slowly next year, and therefore I feel a little less tolerant of le
tting them rise more rapidly right 
now. I think you can make a case that, if interest ra
tes are going to rise a little bit, now is a reasonable time to permit that.  What this means, 
specifically, as I™ve thought about this is, given the decision we™ve just made, we ought to move
 toward what appears to be the tighter alternatives for the short-range sp
ecifications.  In fact, I had in mind that we might even retain 
the M1 range we have now of 4 to 8 percent, in full recognition that, certainly if the Board [staff]™s projections are right, we are most likely to get triggered with some higher interest rates in the near-term future, and that
 seems to me acceptable.   
I wouldn™t want that to go too far, so I would put a collar on the federal funds rate.  In fact, that range, so far as I™m concerne
d, could stay where it is.  But in assessing the probabilities, I 
would assume that we would be moved up to 
5 percent and maybe as 
high as 5-1/4, although I would be reluctant--I wouldn™t want to go beyond that.  I would want some time to pass before 
we went beyond 5 percent, it seems to me.  But wh
at I am suggesting is 
that we be reasonably tight, on the high side anyway.  4/20/76 - 38 - 
    In setting the M1 range, 8-1/2 percent is certainly all right for me, as in alternative C, 
although in a way I would be just as happy with so
mething as low as 8, recognizing that that will 
probably bring an increase in short-term rates in this period be
fore the next meeting.  And I 
wouldn™t want that to go more than 1/4 in the near-term, and certainly no
t more than 1/2 before the next meeting--and I would set the federa
l funds rate ranges in that light.   
Now, in approaching this, I should also note that the New York Bank™s projection of the M1 movements, in the short term, particularly, ar
e significantly lower than the Board [staff]™s.  I 
don™t attach much reliability to eith
er of these, but it so happens 
that the New York estimates are 
6 percent, which is exactly in th
e [middle] of a 4 to 8 percent range.  And the M2 estimates are 
also somewhat lower.  While they are not as 
strikingly much lower as the M1 projections, I 
think, consistent with what I said, the M2 range should be perhaps 8 to 12 percent or a bit lower. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  I™ve quite independently arrived at much the same opinion as Mr. Volcker has just ex
pressed.  For simplicity and to give some 
definiteness to the discussion so that members of
 the Committee may either move as I suggest or 
differ strongly, I would suggest that we take 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; 8 to 12 for M2; and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 or possibly 5-1/2, though I doubt that we would want to go as high as 5-1/2 in practice, for the federal funds rate.  Who would like to speak now?  Yes, Mr. Jackson. 
MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I would agree wi
th that.  However, I would think that we would want to then discuss this perennial topic of the zones of indifference.  So if we go to the   4-1/2 to 5-1/4, we probably expect the Desk to focus around 4-7/8, which means a range of 4-3/4 
to 5, which would suit me fine.  I don™t see any 
need to discuss that any more.  Those other ranges are certainly all right.  I don™t expect that we™ll see a volat
ile M2 in which it™s quite as 
widely fluctuating under those circumstances.  If 
anything, we might see it on the weak side, to 
the extent that you move.  Therefore, I would th
ink that, under these circumstances, leaning on 
the M1 side might be a little more 
prudent than giving equal balance. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Partee now, please. MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I would be
 very hesitant about having a discreet tightening move at this point.  [I™m] trying to th
ink of this in terms of
 (A) the condition of the economy, (B) the record of monetary policy as it 
would be perceived by the public over the last couple of quarters, and (C) the state of the markets, which I think would be very sensitive to an 
increase. 
Now, as far as the state of the economy is concerned, we™ve had a pretty good quarter, if the Commerce Department figures are right.  We 
had a rather poor quarter, if the staff estimates 
are right for the first quarter-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh no, I say if the staff is right we haven™t had quite so good a quarter-- MR. PARTEE.  --5-1/2 percent, which I think a lot of people would regard as a poor quarter at this stage in the recovery, with a 7-1/2 percent unemployment rate.  But you know, 
there™s a lot of room to go, and 
we™re just now beginning to get some life in housing, we™re just 
now beginning to see the first indications of some possible increase in plant and equipment 
4/20/76 - 39 - 
    expenditures, new orders for durable goods.  And I think that a lot of people would [unintelligible] that a discrete move toward tig
htening would be pretty premature on the part of 
the Federal Reserve.   
They might think so, especially
 when they looked at the average rates of growth in the money numbers over the recent past and saw what
 is shown here on appendix table 3--that M1 
on a quarterly basis increased 2-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter [of 1975] and 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 1976; and M2 increased 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 9.5 percent in the first quarter of 1976.  They might, I 
think with some justification, feel
 that this was a rather quick move [to tighten], given these substantially lower numbers than presumably the Committee was 
shooting at [unintelligible]. 
The third point that I wanted to emphasize was 
the state of the market.  I think that an 
increase of size in the [federal] funds rate right now would be truly--the market was burned on this a month or so ago when they thought there 
was a sign of change in the direction, which they regarded as a possible cyclical turn.  They would this time, I thi
nk, figure this is for real, after there had been some kind of a false signal before
; but now [they would figure] there was really a 
change, and they would now regard this as working into a period of rising interest rates.  That 
could give you quite a market 
reaction, I think, enough of a market reaction that you would soon 
jeopardize the growth rates in M2 and M3.   As Steve pointed out, I believe, we™ve got a lot of savings deposits out there that are going to move, and they™re going to move when market
 rates move appreciably above 5 percent, or 
5-1/4 at the highest, which is the savings and loan passbook rate.  So I wouldn™t resist a little, perhaps, tightening in the funds rate, but I think 5-1/4, which is half a point above where we are now, is quite [a bit of] tightening, and 5-1/2, which you suggested as a possible specification for the funds rate, is a lot of tightening, and so I just could not buy those suggestions.   Now, I also think that we would be best serv
ed to leave the expected short-term growth 
rates in the monetary aggregates centered on where 
they are in alternative 
B.  Because there™s a large increase in M1 for the mont
h of April--it is not fully determined, but it™s pretty well in 
place.  And so you would have to bank on the appreci
able moderation in the growth rate in M1 in 
May in order to come down within a restricted 
target range.  So my own preference is for 
alternative B--I would take the specs both for the funds rate and fo
r the aggregates as written in 
alternative B. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  You™re probably right in your recommendation, but I 
think that in some respects your comments ma
y prove misleading to the Committee.  Under 
alternative B you had 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 for the federal funds rate, and the range that I suggested was 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, though I spoke of 5-1/2. MR. PARTEE.  You mentioned 5-1/2. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I mentioned that as a pos
sibility.  Now, the difference between the two as far as the midpoints are concerned is just 1/
8 of 1 percent, and I simply wanted to record that. 
4/20/76 - 40 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  Mr. Chairman, if you meant a 4-1/
2 to 5-1/4 range for the funds rate, I find that acceptable, but I would rather associate 
it with the growth ranges [of the monetary 
aggregates] shown in alternative B. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s all right, but you see, there again, you may well be 
right, but the difference is very, very small.  You may be shading in
 the right direction, there™s no question there, but I do want to point out that the difference is very small.  Mr. Mayo, please.   
MR. MAYO.  I would like to associate myse
lf with the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 range, Mr. 
Chairman.  I think, again, that it™
s the top figure that™s the critical one.  I don™t think the lower figure has too much practical sign
ificance at this point except as
 a psychological lower end of our range.   To the extent that the midpoint has signifi
cance--although maybe it ha
s more significance than some of us would like--I thi
nk it is better to have that up
 just a shade to give sort of 
substance to the idea of permitting--and I like the phrase ﬁpermittingﬂ--the market to adjust 

maybe 1/8 or so higher in terms of our resi
stance points rather than doing any outright encouragement in a more direct manner.   
I would keep M1 at 5 to 8 even though that seems to be below alte
rnative B.  Again, I 
think the upper end of the range here is the critical fi
gure.  I really don™t care much whether the 
lower is 4 or 5, but I think the 8 percent is quite appropriate here.  And I™m really not too worried about Chuck™s point on what may happen in May in 
an 8 percent [specification] where April is at 8.  I think we can still qualify unde
r that to the extent that we need to.  So I would vote for 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 to show some direction, 
very faint it is true, and I think that™s the way it should be, and an M1 that would have an 8 percent rather than a 9 percent top. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Guffey now, please. MR. GUFFEY.  Yes, I™d like to associate myself with the recommendation [you] made, 
Mr. Chairman, with the exception as to the federal f
unds rate.  I would prefer to see it set 4-1/2 to 5-1/2, with the thought that we w
ould reach the 5 percent, the mid 
part of that range, by the time 
this Committee meets next month.  It seems fairly
 clear to me--from all the projections from the 
staff, and from the people around this table as th
ey talked about the long-term targets, and I 
think, indeed, from the market--that the rates ar
e going to get increased sometime in the near 
term and certainly by the end of 1976.  I think 
the projections are that, by early 1977, we may 
have a federal funds rate of some
thing between 6 and 7 percent.   I™d like to see us start moving now.  I think 
there would be very little disruption in the 
market other than on the very short-range basis.  
And I™d like to see us take those steps gradually from now forward rather than findi
ng ourselves in the fall or at th
e first of the year having to go up rather rapidly in the federal funds rate.  So I would up the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 with rather specific directions to the Desk 
to reach 5 percent by this time by next month. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. Kimbrel, please. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, if our visits wi
th some key businessmen the last couple of 
weeks in New Orleans and Jacksonville--areas
 that we have generally regarded as 4/20/76 - 41 - 
    sluggish--[give us] a reasonable reading, than we have some concern that recovery is so much 
stronger than the numbers would seem to indica
te.  Sure, these people are talking about the difficulty with apartments, condominiums, offi
ce buildings, even shipyards and airplane building, and yes, even cigars, but by and large they are exuding an awful lot of optimism.  
Apparently, within the c
onfines of their own business, [they] are making decisions on that basis 
[while] also accepting that unemployment is still a 
little high.  They are not reading this as taking 
a significant social toll because of th
e opportunities to provide for that.   
Against this, I think we feel that inflation 
could break out a good deal sooner than would appear [to be the case now].  The recent price in
creases of steel and copper and gasoline, [even 
though] supplies are assumed to be reasonable, has 
heightened the concern for price adjustment.  
So, for this reasoning, I would like to associate myself with alternative B and the number you suggested.  But definitely for 4-1/2 to 5-1/2, maybe for the reasons Mr. Guffey has suggested, 
and to move to the midpoint of that before our next meeting. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimb
rel.  Mr. MacLaury now, please. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I™d like to associate myself with 
something that Paul Volcker said at the outset, na
mely, that the path laid out for us by the staff 
on table 4(a) of the aggregates for M1 or M2 under alternative B just seems to me not realistic.  
To start out the second quarter with a 7 percent annual rate and to expect that, given the strength of the economy as I see it--and I™m much more c
onfident about that than Chuck Partee seems to 
be--that we™re going to have 5 percent annual rates of growth by the fourth and first quarter of next year--I don™t think that™s likely to transpire.   I think that it™s much more li
kely to be on the higher side.  The pressure certainly will be for faster rates of growth than that, at least that™s my expectation, and for that reason I, too, like Paul, would like to see us begin to move in the 
direction of allowing, and I think that™s the key word, ﬁallowing,ﬂ some increase
 in interest rates.   Therefore, I don™t buy his prescription as to how it happens.  I think, for political reasons, it™s very important that we continue to attach some significance to these aggregates and let 
interest rates, in effect, move as we try to pursue those aggregates.  I recognize that we are in a 
bit of a box on this because the aggregates have behaved erratically over the past year, but I have not convinced myself that 4 equals 8 yet.
  I™ve managed to stretch myself to--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Four does equal 8 on the basis of the errors involved on the seasonal calculations. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Well, I recogniz
e that that™s the point you 
have made, but I find that I 
can™t go along with it, at least fo
r a policy decision.  I™m as far as saying 4 equals 6 in this kind 
of a context.  So, to be specific, then, I also, growing out of this feeling, have not liked our setting 4 percentage point ranges for your short-term targets and th
en 2 percentage point zones of indifference.   I would prefer, therefore, the prescription to follow a modified alternative B, but call it 5 to 
7 percent for M1, and that would, so far as I™m c
oncerned, be a zone of indifference.  I would not move the funds rate within that range--and simila
r kinds of ranges for M2, 8-1/2 to 10-1/2.  And 4/20/76 - 42 - 
    a funds rate range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 because I ag
ree with you, I am not interested in seeing a big 
movement upward in short-term ra
tes.  But I am interested in 
beginning to see a move in short-
term rates if that comes about because aggregates
 are growing faster than this range of 5 to 
7 percent that I would like to specify for M1. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If
 I may just interject one thing here, Mr. Chairman, 
because there may be some misunderstanding.  I cer
tainly have the feeling that in this time we 
ought to be responding to the aggregates, too.  If I said something that didn™t-- 
MR. MACLAURY.  You left the rang
e wide and I would prefer that-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  
We have a difference on the range, but the philosophy that you were expressing I share in this particular instance. MR. PARTEE.  Did you call that alternative B,  Bruce? MR. MACLAURY.  I called it a modified alternative B. 

MR. PARTEE.  But the funds rate B, ah, no-- 
MR. MACLAURY.  Now, on the funds rate range, you see, the lower end is B and you can call it whatever you wish. MR. PARTEE.  All right. 
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, may I humbly suggest
 that if 4 equals 8, then 8 equals 4, and the sum of them is 12 equals 12, so we
 still have to pay some attention. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Th
ank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Black. MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I come out-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Do you want to comment on Mr. Winn™s-- 
MR. BLACK.  I™m still so puzzled ov
er what is meant there that--  
MR. WINN.  I got a deafening sile
nce.  With that I™ll retreat. 
MR. BLACK.  I almost have for
gotten what I wanted to say. MR. MORRIS.  You wish to resign from the FOMC? 

MR. BLACK.  I haven™t had enough mathematic
s to comment in this group.  I think I 
come out really closer to Gove
rnor Partee than anyone else there.  There are several reasons you might point out for not making any overt move
 right now.  One would be, of course, the sensitivity of markets, as you poi
nted out.  Another would be that, for the recovery to proceed quite satisfactorily, it still has got a long way to go.  Still another would be that this could create some problems for our foreign trading partners. 
 These are reasons that we™re going to have when the time does come to move, I thi
nk, regardless of when that might be.  
4/20/76 - 43 - 
    The reason that I would prefer not to do it now is basically because I think that a lot of the 
strength in the aggregates that we have seen ju
st recently does not stem from any strength in loan 
demand.  That™s still very weak at the banks, an
d I think a lot of it comes from tax refunds and 
the other seasonal factors that Steve was mentio
ning.  So I would hold off for the time being and go with alternative B with the expectation, probably, that by next time the move that most people 
seem to favor would be appropriate.  But I™d like 
to learn a little bit more about those aggregates.  
They™ve never expanded very fast unless we™ve had strong credit demand, and we simply don™t 
have that yet, so we may be seeing bogeys th
at really don™t exist at the present time.   
I would frame the directive in
 terms of the aggregates, a
nd while I wouldn™t want the 
federal funds average to move up by more, say, than 1/8 or a 1/4 or something of that sort, I 
would like to see a little more 
variability introduced.  And Alan has made the point many times 
that when you [unintelligible] the rates, they really don™t give you any signal at all because banks assume they™ll be able to adjust
 their reserve positions at a constant federal funds rate, and so we lose the advantage of federal funds as a signal.  So I™d like to see a little variability there without the overall average moving up.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Coldwell now, please. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I think th
e recovery is moving along well, and I™m 
really not awfully unhappy about what I™ve been hearing.  I think I would buy in on Bruce™s comment that if we™re going up, I™d like to have the market and the aggregates lead us there 
rather than have us lead them to a higher level at the present time.   
I don™t have much confidence in these Ms and the figures that we™re projecting here.  We might have as high as a 10 or a 12 percent blip 
show up suddenly, and I would hate very much to 
have us have to react sharply to bring the federal funds rate upward to 5 percent.  I think it™s going to be moving there someday, but we™ve been 
told repeatedly around this table for months 
on end that the short-term rates are going to move up.  I think I 
agree that someday we™re going 
to get there, but I don™t see any reason to force it if things are moving along well.   So, I guess in part on the basis of the fact that we™ve just dropped to a 4-1/2 percent lower limit on the long range, it would seem
 to me that we shouldn™t be 
accepting much less than that 
in the short range.  So I™d put my lower figure at 
4-1/2, and the upper figure of 8-1/2 is fine with me.  I would not widen that federal funds range to
 as high as 4-1/2 to 5-1/2.  It™s the one thing we™re able to do in the intermeeting periods here
--be very close to whatever the target and the 
middle point are.  I noticed the averages for the 
weeks where I don™t think they varied more than 
12 basis points or some such ove
r the past four weeks.   So if we™re going to look at letting the market
 lead us out of this, and they think they™re getting strong credit demands, why, I™m willing to le
t the things tighten up 
a little bit in a modest 
and very orderly and slow fashion.  But I™m not pr
epared to jump.  So we™re talking of a 4-3/4 
center point on federal funds now, 4-7/8 to 5 would be fine with me.  I certainly would not carry 
that up without reconsidering it up to the 5-1/4 range.  So 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 centered on 4-3/4, I guess it is, or on 4-7/8, that™s all right with me.   
4/20/76 - 44 - 
    Your zone of indifference--take that 2 point sl
ice out of the middle, from 4-1/2 to 8-1/2--I 
guess means 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 as a zone.  I might even 
take that zone a little 
farther.  You say 4 is equal to 8, then 4-1/2 must equal 8-1/2, so in 
this case I™d almost treat the whole doggone zone as a zone of indifference and stay at 4-7/8.  That™s all, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell. Mr. Balles now. MR. BALLES.  All this talk about 4 equals 
8 reminds me, Mr. Chairman, that I hope the 
staff will in the near future carry through with wh
at I thought was the decisi
on at the last meeting 
to start providing us with data that show both the levels and the growth rates of the Ms on a moving average basis.  That™s the way you got away
 from the 4 equals 8 problem, to use floater 
data.  And the more work my own staff has done 
on this, the more I™m convinced that that™s the 
way to get away from these erratic random fluctua
tions month to month, or even week to week.   
But having said that with regard to the short-run specifications, one fairly strong feeling that I do have is that whatever these short-run specs are, they ought to be designed in a way that move us systematically within
 the longer-term ranges that we
 have debated and carefully discussed this morning.  And if they aren™t m
oving systematically toward those ranges, then I 
think something is wrong.  In other words I had a 
presumption that if we™re
 outside the range, we ought to be moving back toward it within a 
one- or two-month horizon because we do have a 
chance to examine these longer-term
 ranges every three months.   
With regard to the specific short-term range
s for the April-May period, I would come out 
with alternative C specifications for M1 and M2 and the federal funds range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/2, much for the reasons Mr. Guffey and Mr. Kimbrel have already discussed. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Who™d like to speak next?  Mr. Wallich. 
MR. WALLICH.  I think the question before us
 is whether to bring to an end this nice period of stable interest rates.  It has done a great deal for the market, it™s given everybody a 
chance to soak up liquidity, put on some fat. 
 Sometimes I wonder whet
her perhaps too much 
liquidity and too much stability [unintelligible] re
sist over time a tightening move, but it has been 
a very favorable period.   Now the answer, it seems to me, is that it™s pr
etty late in the expansion--one year has gone by and interest rates are still at their low.  We now find that th
e expansion is stronger than we had thought, certainly in the first quarter and quite likely over time
, and that leads me to think 
that probably we™d better bite this bullet.  There™s also the point of consistency with the long-run targets.   
I subscribe to what various members have sai
d, but I™d like to add one point.  It™s been suggested that the short-run move
ments of the aggregates should 
not [unintelligible] within the cone of growth rates that looks so nice on paper but within a band which allows for a wider range in the early stages because that™s quite 
consistent with reaching a narrow range in the 
longer run.  Of course, if that were to be the advice, then these narrow ranges we set for the aggregates on the two-month period are not very
 meaningful.  On the 
other hand, I think the width of the band that is implied in allowing 
the ultimate range to have its effect in the 
immediate two-month period is so wide as to 
deprive us altogether of all guidance for the 
4/20/76 - 45 - 
    aggregates of those two months.  So the conclusion at which I™ve arrived is that it may well be 
better to have a somewhat wider band in the sh
ort-run, two months, but not anywhere near the full freedom given by applying that band over the whole period.   Well, if we need to be consistent with our long-term targets being at a somewhat lower 
growth rate of the aggregates, I would see nothing wrong with going to 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 and to 8 to 12.  I am not enamored of a zone of indifference 
within this at this time.  However, I started 
talking about interest rates, and while I would like to see us get back to an aggregates target--and that™s why I™ve been setting this out--the funds rate is really the crucial element.  And it should 
be, to accommodate the appropriate changes, ev
en if we have, as I think we should, an 
aggregates target.  So I™d begin with a funds rate then, which, at 4-1/2 to 5-1/2, I would think would be about right, and structure around that in the manner I said.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.
  And who would like to speak?  Mr. 
Gardner. MR. GARDNER.  Just simply to say I would go 
with alternative C, 4-1/2 to 5-1/4.  My feelings have been expressed by other members. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner. 
MR. WINN.  I think this 
would be my thinking too. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Winn. 
 Who else would like to comment? MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, Mr. Baughman. 

MR. BAUGHMAN.  I would be inclined at this point in time, I think rather strongly, in the 
direction of Partee™s and Black™s comments, which I construe [to be] in the direction of being prepared to [make] just a very slight firming in
 the funds rate.  And then observe the aggregates for another month before we conclude that we are seeing in them the beginnings of a rather 
strong surge in monetary and credit expansion. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Would anyone 
else like to say anything? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If I could come back just a second, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yeah. 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I 
have recognized what Mr. Black and Mr. Partee are saying.  I™m not sure there™s all 
that much difference between myse
lf and their comments except 
to this extent.  I am worried about the inflation th
ing that a number of people [are worried about].  I think the [unintelligible] figures
 are unreal, and I™d just as s
oon make a move right now in the 
face of what I suspect are going to be much worse inflation figures 
in the next few months.  But I 
don™t want the federal funds rate to go above 5 percent very quickly, and I really don™t want it, as 4/20/76 - 46 - 
    I see it now, to go above 5-1/4 percent--which I think is expressed in your specifications--before the next meeting.  At least not without a lot more 
information than I have now.  So in that sense 
I™m not sure I™m very different from their comments.   
I do think we have a technical problem with 
the Treasury financing, perhaps.  I would like to see the market [unintelligible
], if we™re going to go up, lead us up on the basis of some of the 
aggregates.  But if we™re going to move, we probably will have to 
move pretty quickly to get in 
front of the Treasury financing, and we may be le
ft with the choice of making a very small step 
now, let™s say 4-7/8, and not doing anything almost regardless of 
what the aggregates are doing until we get pretty well into May. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  With 
a midpoint of 4-7/8? 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That™s right.  No, I don™t think this is inconsistent with what we™re saying, but I™m almost 
saying you may want to take that 
step even if the market isn™t 
leading right at the moment. 
MR. PARTEE.  That is, the [one-]eighth. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The [
one-]eighth move, that™s right. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That is, the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent range would mean going up 1/8 
but no more than that. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  Almost regardless of what 
happens in the aggregates.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And it would mean
--well you™re not going to have much 
information, you see.  All that you™ll have 
is, you™ll have new information tomorrow and 
Thursday on the aggregates. MR. PARTEE.  Mr. Chairman?  That™s quite accep
table to me.  My problem is that I think 
that the 8 percent growth rate for M1 in April is pretty hard information. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t know, I am puzzled
 why you say that.  I™d say that it™s very soft. MR. PARTEE.  Because-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Why do you say that?  The figures aren™t in-- 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, all right, let me just say 
that my hunch is that April is going to be 
8 percent, may be a little above 8 percent, and if so, taking a range [for M1] that has the 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range rather biases us toward movi
ng [the federal funds rate] all the way to 5-1/4. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Biases you to moving, but then I want to constrain how far you move. 
MR. PARTEE.  Well, I mean, that™s a different
 ball game if that™s what you want to do. 
4/20/76 - 47 - 
    VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  Well, I want to be pretty reluctant to get to 5-1/4. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well now, I still don™t know what your problem is, Chuck.  The 
upper limit for your federal funds rate suggestion was-- 
MR. PARTEE.  5-1/4. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --5-1/4, and therefore, as of today, why do you breathe heavily when you say that you still say 5-1/4. 
MR. PARTEE.  --with a 5 to 9 range on M1.  I believe that making a 4-
1/2 to 8-1/2 [range for M1] biases us toward the likelihood that we™re going to feel compelled to go to 5-1/4. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It 
doesn™t in our projections.  As a matter of fact, it 
biases it the other way, but on the Board™s projections-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  As I said before, Mr. 
Partee may be entirely right, but I do think 
that you are engaging in very fine tuning.  The difference that is being quarreled, 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 and 5 to 9--I can toss a coin on that, really, when it comes down to it. 
MR. COLDWELL.  But I don™t th
ink it™s fine tuning, Mr. Chairman, when you change the 
midpoint of the range of the fe
deral funds rate, because that means a very prompt move--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, no, no, no, there I-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  Even though it™s onl
y an eighth, it™s still a move. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Who else 
would like to speak?  Well, if
 no one else does, then let me indicate where I think we are.  Now, the federal 
funds rate, to start with that, I think that there is a pretty clear consensus for a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 [range].  We can test that out, but that™s the way I 
read the summary.  Now, we don™t have to test th
e lower limit.  Let™s test the upper limit.  The 
members of the Committee who would prefer the 
5-1/4 percent will raise their hands, please. 
MR. BROIDA.  Seven, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right,
 [my vote] would make that eight.  Now, as for the 
monetary growth rates, there is a little more 
dispersion in the thinking 
of the Committee, but the 
differences are within a very, very narrow range.  There is some sentiment for 4 to 8 for M1, 
there is some sentiment for 5 to 9, a very thin ma
jority favors 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, but it™s a razor thin majority, and let me just put this question to th
e Committee.  Let me have a show of hands.  Not 
what you prefer--those who would find 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 acceptable will kindly raise their hands. MR. BROIDA.  Eight. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, as for M2, our recording secretary, who is always so thorough and so meticulous, hasn™t given me 
enough information, but on the basis of the 
incomplete reporting on this tally sheet, 8 to 12 seems acceptable.  Let us have a show of hands 

on 8 to 12, those who find it acceptable for M2. 4/20/76 - 48 - 
    MR. BROIDA.  Ten, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, next we have to determine the language of the directive. 
MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, 
before you go into that, would it not be wise to instruct the Desk as to the relative weights of these 
two measures, because I believe last month we 
recommended that they be equa
lly weighted, and that may or 
may not be the procedure this 
month. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well suppose we indicate to the Desk through a show of hands whether equal weighing, approximately equal 
weighing, would again be the wish of the Committee.   
MR. BROIDA.  Eight. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, now, let™s turn
 to the language of th
e directive.  Would 
the language at the top of page 3, alternative B, namely, ﬁto im
plement this policy while taking 
account of developments in domestic and internat
ional financial markets, the Committee seeks to 
achieve bank reserve and money ma
rket conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary 
aggregates over the period ahead.ﬂ  Would this 
be an acceptable directive?  Let us have a show 
of hands on that. MR. BROIDA.  Ten, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, unles
s members of the Committee want to raise questions or 
make further comments, I think we™re ready for 
a formal vote.  Now, we™ll be voting on the 
following:  the rate of growth of M1 for the two-month period of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 [percent]; M2 of 8 to 12 percent; a federal funds rate range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 [percent]; equal weighting, approximately, of M1 and M2; and the language of a
lternative B.  Any questions as to what it is we™ll be voting on? MR. COLDWELL.  Just, well, our zone of indifference in the middle? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And an understanding of the zone of indifference of 2 percentage points if that is acceptable to the Committee.
  All right we™re rea
dy for a formal vote. 
MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, would the Committ
ee also like to inst
ruct the Manager to take account of various reserve measures, si
nce we are no longer specifying RPD [reserves 
available to support private nonbank deposits]? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we™re not ready for that.  We™ve decided to go through a 
study period. MR. BROIDA.  During the course 
of study and experimentation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now during that period, what did we decide about RPD during the study period? 4/20/76 - 49 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  To drop it, I believe, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right,
 we do some things right.  Now let™s take the vote. 
MR. BROIDA: 
Chairman Burns           Yes 

Vice Chairman Volcker    Yes 

President Balles         Yes 

President Black          Yes 

Governor Coldwell        Yes 

Governor Gardner         Yes 

Governor Jackson         Yes 

President Kimbrel        Yes 

Governor Partee          Yes 

Governor Wallich         Yes 

President Winn           Yes 
Eleven to nothing, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it is time for 
lunch, and we™ll reconvene in executive session. 
[Lunch recess] [Executive session] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now gentlemen, we™re
 ready to take up the Memorandum of 
Discussion.  It™s still a very troublesome subject.  And we wish 
we didn™t have this problem to 
deal with, but here it is.  Now, Mr. O™Connell, I think, ought to advise us as to recent developments in the lawsuit we™re engaged in 
and of any developments that are unhappily not 
favorable--we™ve got to deal with the facts as they are.  Mr. O™Connell, please. MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  As 
a point of reference, I™ll direct the Committee™s attention to the facts 
recited at the last meeting; to the filing--pursuant to court 
order--both with the plaintiff and with the court; and to designated documents flowing from the 
court™s order.   We delivered to the plaintiff™s counsel segregable facts drawn from the Memorandum of 
Discussion of January and of February 1975, accompanied by certain related materials that we 
felt added sense and added a certain flow of understanding to the facts given.  And except for that, we delivered to the court a totally complete package of
 the Memorandum of Discussion, 
indicating on the court™s copy that which we 
had given the plaintiff and explaining, in an affidavit executed by Mr. Broida, our reasons for withholding certain portions of that Memorandum of Discussion.   
We heard nothing from the plaintiff until April 5, at which time he served on us a 
memorandum filed that day with the court, in 
which he took objection to each of the three categories of materials [that were] 
withheld from him and [that had b
een] indicated to the court.   
4/20/76 - 50 - 
    At the Committee™s last meeti
ng, we had indicated the three types of materials generally, 
and they related to, very quickly in summary form, [first,] statem
ents principally descriptive of procedures, which if disclosed would result in disclosure of the deliberative processes of the Committee.  Second, the information received 
from foreign central banks and information 
relating to negotiations with or
 among such banks, disclosure of which the Committee claimed, 
or would, constitute a result highly undesirable, namely, the cessation of flow of such exchange 

in information.  And finally, materials of the natu
re covered by that portion of the court™s earlier order which the Committee had authorized and as 
to which an appeal had been taken.  And we felt that, when we had refused disclosure in another form, disclosure in the Memorandum of 
Discussion was not required by the court™s order, and thus we were disinclined to [disclose in such cases].   
The plaintiff has filed a memorandum of object
ion stating in principle that he doesn™t really understand the three bases for withholding and that he doesn™t understand what is meant 
by procedural matters that could l
ead to identification of the deliberative process.  He objects to 
the total withholding of the types of materials that we described 
in memorandum, and he let this 
be known to the court.  He asks no relief in his memorandum.  He merely makes known his 
objection for the reason, I™m certain, that he an
ticipates that Judge Waddy will issue a further 
order more narrowly construing against this Co
mmittee his earlier mandate
 for production.  And thus the result would be that the court would require the Committee to disclose more of the 
Memorandum of Discussion than 
had earlier been ordered.   We have filed nothing in response to this
, simply because, at the moment, it™s our 
judgment that nothing was said by the plaintiff in th
is paper that couldn™t have been anticipated or that wasn™t obvious on its face.  He objects 
to our withholding what we did.  I think he has 
inscribed any reasons to his objection that weren™t plain and open on their face, Mr. Chairman, 
and at this time neither the Department of Justic
e--our counsel in this matter--nor we, have seen 
fit to file any form of reply.  
We earlier asked the court that, if 
the court is disposed to more 
narrowly mandate [the scope for withholding in] 
our production to the plaintiff, we would like the opportunity at that time to oppose such or take an
 appeal from that order.  I think that™s all I 
have to say, Mr. Chairman.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. O™Connell.  All right, any questions? MR. COLDWELL.  One question, Tom.  Having 
gone through this process, what™s your judgment about long-run efficacy of an appeal? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I have no change of position 
of the appeal merit with respect to the 
Record of Policy Actions, as earlier indicated.  And what has now been filed doesn™t affect that appeal.  The filing I™ve just described, Governor, relates solely to the Memorandum of 
Discussion. 
MR. COLDWELL.  That™s what I™m talking about. 

MR. O™CONNELL.  All right.  My position isn™t 
changed in terms of any basis for appeal 
at this time, for the reason that the court™s order 
hasn™t been altered since it was issued.  If the court, pursuant to a memorandum of this nature
, issues an order mandating further and more 
4/20/76 - 51 - 
    broad disclosure of the document--the Memorandu
m of Discussion--I feel 
I would then be in better position to urge an appeal on the merits of
 such and order.  At this time, my position 
remains as earlier stated--that we don™t have a vi
able basis for appeal because our order is only that we produce segregable facts, which is part of the statute, a
nd any appeal would be challenging the statute per se.   MR. WALLICH.  Well, when the plaintiff reje
cted your argument with respect to category 
two, foreign central bank negotiations and so forth, did he simply say that he didn™t understand the argument or that he rejected the point that th
is would interfere with the flow of information? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  He avoided-
-Governor may I very briefly [quote him], his argument 
is very short.  ﬁNor does plaintiff understand the exemption claimed in the second 
categoryﬂ--which is the category to which you refe
r--ﬁwhere defendant states that disclosure of 
certain of these arguably segregable facts 
‚would impair the deliberative process of the 
Committee.™ﬂ   
And that was our conclusion, that if we made
 disclosure, it would st
op the flow of such information, and the result would be that it woul
d impair the deliberative process.  He says 
further, ﬁplaintiff™s objection rests on the esta
blished legal proposition that exemption 5 of the 
Freedom of Information Act protects from di
sclosure only documents reflecting opinions, 
recommendations, and deliberations comprisi
ng part of a process by which governmental 
decisions and policies are formulated.  Exemp
tion 5 does not protect purely factual material 
contained in deliberative memoranda a
nd segregable from its content.ﬂ   
He then says in conclusion, ﬁit is clear that neither statements
 descriptive of procedure, nor facts whose release would impair deliberative 
process is within exemption 5 since neither 
category would include statements constituting recommendations or opinions.ﬂ   
I think he™s wrong in his interpretation, both of the statute and of the case--the Sears case--from which our thesis is drawn, Governor. 
 We™ll await the court™s determination of the 
correctness, or not, of his assertion.  I think we can sustain what we™ve done in this regard. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions? MR. EASTBURN.  Could I ask a question on the other appeal?  The appeal on the Record 
of Policy Actions, is that under consideration now?  Is that where that stands? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  We have noted 
our appeal.  We have 40 days
 within which to file our brief.  That brief is now under preparation.  Plai
ntiff™s counsel will then have 40 days thereafter 
to file a reply to it.  
It™s in that process now. MR. EASTBURN.  If we were to move to 30 days, it would have no effect on that? MR. O™CONNELL.  Certainly not on 
that appeal point.  As I discussed briefly with others here on the staff, and if I may make the comment,
 any other action taken, I™d have to give some 
thought of a judgment of possible im
pact, but with respect to the point of appeal as to which you now have raised the question, I see no virtual impact on that. 
4/20/76 - 52 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions? MR. COLDWELL.  This is just th
e first court we™re talking about? MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, the District C
ourt for the District of Columbia. 
MR. COLDWELL.  In terms of the Memorandu
m of Discussion, the way it™s drafted now, 
you do have an appeals court you can go to? MR. O™CONNELL.  We do. 

MR. COLDWELL.  And any further beyond that I assume? 

MR. O™CONNELL.  Depending on th
e nature and the appeal of the court™s decision, yes. MR. PARTEE.  The Court of Appeals is in D.C., Tom? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  The U.S. Court of A
ppeals for the District of Columbia. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, gentlemen, I woul
d now like to return to the Memorandum 
of Discussion.  We talked about this at some 
length at the preceding meeting of the Committee, 
[the executive session] preceding the regular meeti
ng of the Committee, and Mr. Coldwell at that 
time made some recommendations on his own behalf
 and on behalf of several members of [the 
subcommittee] who served with him.  Those 
recommendations by and large, with one or two amendments, seemed entirely congenial to members of this Committee, including myself.  I had 

a lingering doubt, not articulated clearly in my ow
n mind, then.  I felt that the matter was of such 
importance that it might be best to defer a fina
l decision for a few weeks so that we would have 
the opportunity to appraise second thoughts, if any occurred to us.   Now, working with the staff on the problem 
connected with the lawsuit I did develop second thoughts.  And I communicated those s
econd thoughts to members of the Committee at a 
special meeting [on March 29], when I indi
cated that I would probably be making a 
recommendation to this Committee that the Me
morandum of Discussion be discontinued.  I 
reached this conclusion, and I ha
ve not reached it lightly.   
I must say that I had a certain attachment
, nostalgic perhaps, to the Memorandum of 
Discussion, which has been a part of our institution for many years. 
 How useful it has been to us or to scholars, I really don™t know, but I™ve been
 quite willing to assume that it™s been very 
useful.  And that™s been my judgment, although 
there™s never a judgment based on concrete or 
definite knowledge.  We™re livi
ng in a new and very different world, and I think the time has 
come to take a determined step in recogniti
on of the new environment [in which] we find 
ourselves.  It™s not an environment of our 
own choosing, but reality has to be faced.   
Now, in the memorandum that I™ve submitted to
 you, I indicated that premature disclosure 
of segregable facts, such as the court in this lawsuit has ordered us to do, could in some cases 
damage the work of this Committee, particularly if
 the present court or some later court rules that 
we acted inappropriately in withholding certain facts about foreign currency operations or certain 4/20/76 - 53 - 
    facts about procedural matters.  That could embarrass us and weaken us as a monetary policy 
committee.   
The second point that weighs increasingly 
on my own mind is that, as long as the 
Memorandum of Discussion exists
, some of us--certainly seni
or members of our staff and 
probably some members of this Committee, incl
uding myself--will have to spend a large amount 
of time in the effort to comply with court orders
 that may come our way to make portions of the 
Memorandum of Discussion public.   
And the third point that has led me to the pres
ent conclusion is that the procedures that our staff is now proposing seem better than our existi
ng procedures.  From the point of view of the 
general public, we™d be disclosing a good deal more, and disclosing it with some promptness, 
rather than five years later.  And perhaps it ma
y also be a better procedure, though that is less clear from the viewpoint of the Committee.  I think 
that one thing we can be sure of is that the 
adoption of this new--what do you call the policy record [the Record of Policy Actions]? MR. BROIDA.  Just that, the policy record. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This new and more 
elaborate policy reco
rd, the adoption of that--its prompt release--would go a long way toward meeting the charge which keeps on being 
made that the Federal Reserve operates in an at
mosphere of secrecy.  Now, in my note to the 
Committee, I made another suggestion, and I thi
nk these two suggestions should be discussed separately.  They™re related in 
my own mind because they both bear on the general charge of 
secrecy, [and they give us] a way, I think, throu
gh the suggestions that I™m putting before you, to 
deal with it effectively.   
In my note to the Committee, I also suggested 
that the 45-day lag for the release of the 
policy record be shortened to approximately 30 da
ys.  Now, not so long ago, we reduced the lag from 90 days to 45 days, and this reduction did 
not create any market problems, or none of any 
special significance that I™m aware of.  And I be
lieve that further reduction from 45 days to 
approximately 30 days would also have minimal market effects.  Well, that is something that 
Alan Holmes could judge better than the rest 
of us, certainly better than I can.  Now, the reduction from 45 to approximately 30 days in th
is lag could place some strain on our staff, 
particularly if we also decided to expand the policy record, doing that as a substitute for the present Memorandum of Discussion.  But Mr. 
Broida advises me that both proposals are 
feasible--can be managed by the staff.   
Now, some changes will be required in the revi
ew process, and, if we decided to go this way, members of the Committee would have to coope
rate in expediting the process of clearance.  But the proposal, or both proposals, are feasible.   Well, I make the first recommendation sadly, 
but firmly.  The second recommendation, I 
don™t have any feelings about.  I think that it™s probably  harmless from our own standpoint, and 
from the public standpoint probably a wise move
, and I have no sentimen
tal attachment to the 
45-day lag.  Though I confess to a certain sentimental attachment to
 the Memorandum of 
Discussion, I think the time has 
come to give it up.  That™s my recommendation to the 
Committee. 
4/20/76 - 54 - 
    MR. EASTBURN.  Could we be informed about
 the status of the Government in the 
Sunshine [bill], because it may be that if 
we give up [preparing] this Memorandum [of 
Discussion], we may find ourselv
es giving the equivalent anyhow [under] the Government in the 
Sunshine Act. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, unfortunately, it wouldn™t be the equivalent, but Tom 
O™Connell can answer that best. MR. O™CONNELL.  Well, in terms of status, Da
ve, a Government in the Sunshine bill has 
cleared both sub- and parent Government Operati
ons Committees and sub-
 and parent Judiciary Committees and has been given to the Rules Committ
ee for the issuance of a rule as to date and 
nature of debate on the floor.  In the form that we anticipat
e the Rules Committee will receive that bill, which I anticipate will be the Govern
ment Operations [Committee] version, absent the 
amendments urged by the Judiciary Committee, we w
ill have a bill that still contains the onerous 
provisions with respect to the definition of meeting and the transc
ript requirements to which we 
raise strong objection.   As to whether the Federal Open Market Co
mmittee would be automatically included, at 
the present time, in the list of agencies that has 
been filed with the Senate
 version of that bill, [section] 5.5, [the list] does not include by name 
the Federal Open Market Committee.  It does 
include the Federal Reserve Board.  There is an area of interpretation, as I suggested to the Board, [in which], by combining the definitions of agency and member as contained in the bill 

from either the Senate or the House side, the 
Committee might be excluded from the definition 
of [agency] in the Sunshine bill.   
Now, I haven™t openly discussed this, and I certainly wisely have not announced abroad that possibility.  I think it™s a reasonable anticipation--it™s personal to me, it is mine--in which 
other members of the staff concur.   
Both bills require that, [to be an] agency, the members, the collegiate members, [must] be 
appointed to such position by the President.  Y
ou know, we have the fact that the Committee is a 
statutory body [that is] not per se appointed by the President.  
I think committee members in the 
House and Senate would be very much surprise
d, perhaps, if this Committee were to announce 
that [the definition] doesn™t cover us.   I think it™s a reasonable antic
ipation, but failing that and failing an exclusion for this 
Committee, the Committee would be subject to the 
Sunshine bill as it finally comes out, and I 
believe it will come out not much different than 
it presently is--open meetings except for the 10 
exempt areas.  A good number of this Committee™
s functions and discussions would be closed 
and could be closed subject, then, to the requirement of a verba
tim transcript, which would have 
to be reviewed by this Committee, voted on with an explanation given for every deletion and a 

statutory citation for exemption.  And those are only part of the procedural requirements that 
would be imposed on the Committee. 
MR. MAYO.  Now what this adds up to, Tom, is that if we get the Government in the 
Sunshine [Act], we have an even more elabor
ate procedure, because of the tape requirement, 
than the Memorandum of Discussion [impos
es] now.  Is that a fair statement? 
4/20/76 - 55 - 
    MR. O™CONNELL.  Well, I™d certai
nly say, in terms of prepari
ng that transcript, that is, the tape for publication, you are subjecting the 
Committee to what the Chairman has quite 
accurately described has been the burden of the staff and the Chairman with respect to the 

Memorandum of Discussion.  The segregable facts 
operation.  The plaintiff™s filing of April 5 
[required] Art and myself and some of the Chairm
an™s time to go back to these and separate out 
the three categories of exemption that he char
ged were fallacious.  And that took about three more hours to find citations.  I think you™re running into exactly that under this bill, and at the present time it requires the vote of the Committee for 
deletion.  So we would have to look to the Committee™s action of reviewing the ta
pes and voting for deletion.  Yes? MR. EASTBURN.  Is there any [indication] what the timing of that bi
ll might be?  And the 
timing as it might relate to this Committee? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I was told by phone yesterday that, unbeknownst to us, the Rules Committee began consider
ation of this bill. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh really? 

MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  When? 

MR. O™CONNELL.  I didn™t get confirmation of 
this--just before the recess, and they 
stopped because of the recess with the understand
ing that the Rules Committee would return to 
consideration of this im
mediately following recess. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  When
 did they start this? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I was told it started the day before recess.  Now this is from a staff 
member who said he learned 
of this yesterday afternoon. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, would you be good enough to check that out? MR. O™CONNELL.  I™m trying to run th
at down for certain, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This is--there is some work to be done in the Rules Committee and 
therefore-- MR. O™CONNELL.  Well, we™re pushing that to
o.  Assuming the accuracy of the report I 
received, immediately following recess, the Ru
les Committee would begin consideration.  No 
estimate of how long it would be before the comm
ittee, except that I was told they™d hope to 
have a two-day session at maximum on this bill befo
re reporting it out to the House.  When the floor will get the bill I don™t know. 
MR. EASTBURN.  May I, Mr. Chairman, raise a 
question as to whether it™s feasible for us to delay action with respect to the Memorandum 
of Discussion until we get clear indication of 
that?  Would the timing be such as to make th
at a feasible course of action, or do you see it dragging out for so long that it wouldn™t be feasible? 4/20/76 - 56 - 
    MR. O™CONNELL.  Really, I think it depends in
 part on what success we--used in a very [unintelligible] sense--someone 
has in delaying this bill in the Rules Committee.  If it can be 
shown that there are sufficient conflicts between the House and Senate version, or that provisions of the House bill that I think will be before that
 committee are seriously deficient in terms of due 
process of law, conflict with existing law, then
 it™s possible that the Rules Committee will not 
vote the bill out but will send it 
back to committee, which I am 
told will result in a very long delay.  If that isn™t successful, then we anticipate 
[that it will be] on the floor sometime in May.  
Now, if your question is in terms of that time
 relationship, could this Committee defer, then I 
would have to, in turn, defer to the Comm
ittee for its judgment in that respect.   
I think a similar consideration is--and I w
ould raise this with the Chairman and the 
Committee at an appropriate time--the considera
tion to be given to the appeal process on the 
Memorandum of Discussion and the timing of that. 
 For if the District Court issues a stronger mandate for disclosure; and this Committee directs an
 appeal to be taken from that order; and the 
Committee has had dispositive action of its Memora
ndum of Discussion; so that on appeal, the 
Court of Appeal [asks, if it is] true that
 the Committee has totally done away with the 
Memorandum of Discussion, then is
 this not a moot appeal?  I 
think the Committee will want to 
give due consideration to timi
ng subject to those thoughts too. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  As far as the Government
 in the Sunshine Act states its rules, I would say that no matter how that
 legislation is handled--suppose it dies tomorrow--but in my 
own judgment, we would not be affected becaus
e the problems that we™ve been dealing with 
have not grown out of the Government in the 
Sunshine legislation, they™ve grown out of the Freedom of Information Act and [from] this judici
al ruling and kinds of judicial ruling that may 
become law. 
MR. EASTBURN.  The reason I asked that ques
tion was it seemed to me we incur certain 
costs in cutting out the Memora
ndum of Discussion--in terms of 
implications to others on the 
outside, that we™re being more secretive, if you want
 to put it that way, that this is a devious way to get around the law.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That depends how we present it.  I would want to make a virtue of 
this, and never mind how we arrived at it.  We were
 not seeking virtue for the sake of virtue, I™m 
not going to argue that, but if, let us say, we decide to drop the Memorandum of Discussion, all 
right then, we™re doing away with an instrument 
of secrecy retained in the archives for a period 
of five years.  We have a Record of Policy Acti
ons, and that policy record is now going to be very much fuller than it was, so the public wi
ll be informed promptly and much more fully, 
that™s another virtue.  And third, if we adopt 
the second suggestion, you see, cutting the period, that goes further in that direction, and I would present it as a deliberate attempt on the part of the 
Federal Reserve to rid itself of 
the perennial charge of secrecy.  I think that™s the way to present 
it to the public.  Historically, it didn™t arise that way, that™s true, but I think that is not an unfair interpretation. 
4/20/76 - 57 - 
    MR. EASTBURN.  Well, I™ll fini
sh with--there may be others
 who interpret it otherwise, 
and the reason I was asking the point was that, if we™re going to be disclosing through tape what our procedures are, then we needn™t incur any cost on [unintelligible]. MR. PARTEE.  I was going to say, I think we should ask Art, but there are differences between a tape and a Memorandum of Discussion
, fairly significant [ones].  I mean, I don™t 
know that if you were to do the Memorandum of Di
scussion just as it is done now, and if you were to compare it with the tape, there would be
 enough differences that it would raise questions in peoples™ minds.  Isn™t that right? 
MR. BROIDA.  That™s right. 

MR. EASTBURN.  I think the Memorandum is vastly
 to be preferred if we had a choice of one or the other, there™s no question in-- MR. BROIDA.  Well, we do, of 
course, tape--we transcribe these meetings in preparing 
the Memorandum of Discussion.  We try to render 
the substance of discussion in official form, 
omitting repetition and compressing the statements
.  But I think if the Committee was putting a 
transcript of the meeting in the public domain, 
it would be unfortunate that we also put the Memorandum of Discussion, however honest the re
ndition, simply because people could pick at 
every single sentence in the thing.  Every difference in it would be a subject for public comment. SPEAKER(?).  Wouldn™t it be a virtual impossibi
lity to prepare both in terms of time, too? 
MR. BROIDA.  Well, if we had sufficient sta
ff.  The transcript we have now is a rough and ready one.  We would have to be much mo
re precise and careful in catching every specific 
word.  If we were going to publish it, then we could make it in better 
form, in other words. 
MR. COLDWELL.  May I ask a question, Mr. Chai
rman?  Is it possible, Art, to prepare a 
Memorandum of Discussion w
ithout segregable facts? 
MR. BROIDA.  Not without distorting the 
discussion, I don™t believe.  Facts are 
introduced in passing in a large proportion of the statements that are made.  Or what may be 
considered arguable as facts, the court may find other facts, and 
I think it would make a hash of 
the discussion if we had to suppress every fact. MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, question really
 to Tom.  Where do we stand on the 
Memorandum of Discussion over the pa
st five years?  Is there--if 
the suit, say, is sustained, does that open the door to either another suit or a feeling that we should release all of the Memoranda 
of Discussion in the last five years? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Well, as you know, this su
it was directed to two Memoranda.  The ruling of the court is a statement of law interpre
ting the FOIA [the Freedom of Information Act].  
It is applicable to existing Memoranda of Disc
ussion if specific demand were made under that 
court order.  Interpreting that order and under the FOIA, we would have to go through the same 
process with those Memoranda th
at we™ve done with these two. MR. MAYO.  So this would consume all 
of the staff time for a long period-- 
4/20/76 - 58 - 
    MR. O™CONNELL.  It well could. 
MR. MAYO.  --from a practical standpoint
, to prepare them for documentation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It may, that is, as fa
r as the existing Memoranda of Discussion 
over the past five years are concerned; there™s nothing we can do about that.  We™re at the mercy 
of court rulings. MR. COLDWELL.  It seems to me, Mr. Chairma
n, that the real question is whether this proposal of yours that we eliminate the Memorandu
m is perhaps at the moment premature with 
regard to the court™s position, since we have not
 obviously taken appeal or gone further in our appeals on the matter.  I suspect that the Memora
ndum could be written sl
ightly differently.   I guess I have a certain amount of feeling for 
the Memorandum, and I also have a certain 
amount of resistance to the idea of being forced 
into cutting out something that we have done 
which has been helpful, no matter how marginally 
it has been helpful, as 
a track record of the 
Committee.  And I give that up 
with great reluctance, and cons
equently, I see a question of whether this is something we have to do today 
or whether the Government
 in the Sunshine bill and court appeals might provide a 
different set of circumstances to work on two or three months 
from now. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I would answer it by saying, this is something that we don™t 
have to do today.  But I would also say that we are taking risks that, in my judgment, we ought 
not to be taking any longer.  And this can become a question of judgment.  We live in a very 
different environment, and we
 might as well recognize that. 
MR. PARTEE.  That™s what bothers me, Mr. 
Chairman.  I do think that sooner or later 
we™re going to get in trouble with--because there will 
be a court that will define segregable facts 
in a very broad way, because there will be petitioners that will go to very current minutes, that is, 

of meetings within the la
st month or two, or three, or four. 
 And sooner or later we™re going to lose this, and in the meantime, as you say, there will 
be a great deal of effo
rt put in to sanitizing 
in response to each court suit the Memorandum fro
m earlier times.  So I can certainly see your 
point of view.  So it seems like a situation where 
the risks are very great relative to the benefits 
that are gained. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And I think that maybe 
we would want to emphasize the point, rid 
ourselves of this awful charge of secrecy that keeps on being brought against us. MR. PARTEE.  Well, I™m not so sure about th
at.  I think a lot of people are going to say, look you™ve just done away with the [Memorandu
m of Discussion], and therefore how could you be more secretive than that. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, look--something that
 you withhold for five or six years is of very little interest.  When you make the [Memor
andum of Discussion] ava
ilable to the Archives after five or six years have elapsed, is that publicized, Joe? MR. COYNE.  Ed Dale took a look at the 1965 [Memorandum of Discussion].  That™s the 
only reporter I know that has ever come in to take a look at that. 
4/20/76 - 59 - 
    MR. HOLLAND.  As I recall, we asked the Ar
chives people once how many came in, and 
you could count on the fingers of one hand the nu
mber for one year, and that included college 
students-- MR. PARTEE.  Is that so? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Here, we™d
 be putting out a Record of Policy Actions so people learn relatively promptly--after 30 days or 45 da
ys depending on what we do about that rule--a great deal more about what goes on within this Co
mmittee.  This meets, practically, the charge of 
secrecy.  And keeping a record  [the Memora
ndum of Discussion] hidden for five or six years--you know, demagogues have been maki
ng a good deal of noise on that basis. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Isn™t the problem, Mr. Chairman, not that you™re 
comparing [the expanded Record of Policy Acti
ons] with [the Memorandum of Discussion] 
that™s only available after five years, but you™re comparing [the expa
nded Record of Policy Actions] with their hope or expectation that it™s going to be available almost immediately.  And 
[unintelligible] they may lose on that, but they™re 
not intending to lose, therefore, they may feel 
that we™re being even more secretive. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, all right.  You know, there™s one thing that I™ve become accustomed to in my life at the Federal Reserve, and that is, no matter what you do, you™re going 

to get some criticism. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I f
eel this is the issue here, in a sense.  I have no sentimental or nostalgic attachment to the [M
emorandum of Discussion], and it seems to me I 
can live without it very easily.  The only question in my mind is wh
ether, on balance, it helps or hurts us in terms of basically defending ourselves
 in the present situation, when we may be 
subject to the accusation--as nice a face as you try 
to put on it, we are hiding more than we are 
revealing against the hope and expectation that they get the policy. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I wouldn™t mind de
bating that issue, in which we put out promptly twice as much information about our do
ings.  And anyone who charges us with secrecy would have a tough time defending that position.  
It doesn™t mean that cr
iticism like that won™t 
be made. 
MR. COLDWELL.  It could be made rather
 strongly, though, if we follow the staff™s recommendations, that the other elements of 
this be placed in memorandum form, which I 
assume are going to be held under one of the 
exemptions under FOIA.  In which case, you don™t 
even release that at all, period. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, this is so
mething Mr. Broida 
can address best. MR. BROIDA.  The decisions of the Committee,
 the actions of the Committee, would be made public either in the Record of Policy Ac
tions or in the Minutes of Actions, which are available for public inspection downstairs.  The kinds of material we™re proposing for 
memoranda to files were informal understandings, 
agreements, and decisions, such as the--well, 
to take the most recent example, the Chairman 
suggested this morning in connection with the 
Swiss swap debt that a subcommittee work with 
the Treasury to see if we can get a Treasury 
4/20/76 - 60 - 
    takeout.  That™s an informal understanding, there wa
s no vote, there™s no decision.  We™d put that in files and I would consider that to be procedural business of the Committee--that has no place 
in the public record.  MR. COLDWELL.  What about
 the decision on engaging in finance bills by our [Domestic Trading] Desk?  Where [unintelligible] is almost in the same [unintelligible] as our 

decision that they do this. MR. BROIDA.  The understanding was that
 the Desk would actually taper off the holdings, but there was no formal change in the do
llar limit as specified in 
the authorization.  At some point, a subcommittee was appointed to wo
rk with the staff on that and report in six months.  At that time, the Committee presumably 
would make a formal deci
sion either to retain 
or discontinue operations in bankers™ acceptances, and that would be reported. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I was thinking of the finance bills. MR. BROIDA.  Oh, I™m sorry.  There, ther
e was no decision.  And there was no formal 
action.  There was a proposal to go into finan
ce bills, and the Committee 
decided not to adopt a 
proposal. MR. COLDWELL.  Which is a 
decision of the Committee. 
MR. BROIDA.  It has been treated consistent w
ith our past practice as not a formal vote of 
the Committee.  They simply declin
ed to accept a staff recommendation. MR. COLDWELL.  I™m merely poin
ting out that things of that nature will get buried into a memorandum . . . .  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but that is not necessarily the case, you see.  If the Committee felt that things of that
 nature should become a part of a policy record, then that™s 
what we would do.   Now there is apparently a gray area, and therefore, if you travel this route, the suggested route, I don™t know whether I put that in the 
memorandum to the Committee or not, but what I 
had in mind is to have the Secretary make r
ecommendations and then have a subcommittee of 
this Committee go over these items on the gray 
area.  And that subcommittee, pursuant to a 
decision of the entire Committee, might wish to 
keep this gray area severely down, you see, to put as much as is possible, perhaps even pr
ocedural detail, into the policy record.   So that™s conceivable to me, but the suggesti
on about items for file, 
that suggestion might 
go by the board.  I don™t think that decision needs to be made 
immediately, and I think that 
decision ought to be tested out. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  Where would something get 
reported, if at all, when it comes to, let™s say, rather informal guidance to
 the Manager about how the federal funds rate might be handled over time within
 the framework of the formal decision as to what the range is 
for the aggregates or for the federal funds rate itself? 4/20/76 - 61 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think you ought to answer that question in two parts.  First, how is that handled now; and second, how do you visualize it being handled under the proposed new method. 
MR. BROIDA.  Well, we can put as much or as
 little of that kind of understanding in the Record of Policy Actions as the Committee desires.  In the last six months
 of ™75, for example, 
there were such understandings at almost every meeting, and we reported them in the Record of 
Policy Actions.  There was some discussion earlie
r this year about the 
desirability of excluding that kind of--not reaching that kind of understanding formally, so that there would be no need to 
report it.  But if the Committee chose to
 report it, it certainly could be done. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If the Committee 
did not report it in the policy record--is 
that what it™s called?--
it would be your thought that this would be one of these things appearing in the other Memoranda. 
MR. BROIDA.  No, no, I was suggesti
ng that the Committ
ee would not reach formal--would not formally reach an understanding w
ith respect to the interpretation of the funds 
rate; matters would be left to 
the Manager™s interpretation.   VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  It wouldn™t appear in either place. 
MR. BROIDA.  Yes. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It wouldn™t do what? 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It
 wouldn™t appear in either place; either in the 
Memoranda--if that course was chosen. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that course could be chosen under the present method with 
the Memorandum of Discussion. 
MR. PARTEE.  Does it appear in the Memorandum of Discussion? 
MR. BROIDA.  If individual members make co
mments of that sort
.  The Memorandum of 
Discussion plays it straight.  If the members make such suggestions
, it appears.  If the Chairman 
proposes this as part of the vote, then it would so appear. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I™d like to speak
 up in support of your proposal.  I™ll have to confess, even if it™s in heresy, but I don™t have this sentimenta
l attachment to the 
Memorandum of Discussion.  And to
 put it bluntly, I even find it tedious and repetitious.  I think that with the expanded documents that the staff 
has proposed here, the public could be better informed in more of the nature of an executive
 summary than this raw material of things--it 
brings an awful lot of [unintelligible] in the wo
rkshop into the exhibition gallery.  Even if we 
weren™t under pressure to get rid of this, for the reasons that have been cited, I™d be in favor of that anyway.   MR. BAUGHMAN.  I™d like to express support of that view.  It seems to me that both your 
recommendations are good recommendations, and I 
would like to see the Committee adopt them. 
4/20/76 - 62 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thanks. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  The Memorandum of Disc
ussion is a document of uncertain 
parentage, in the first place.  That
 is, it is not a transcript, and consequently is not a full record of 
proceedings.  And therefore, at whatever time a
nd in whatever circumstance it™s released, it will 
be a document subject to suspicion as to what™s 
included and what™s not included.  I think it is a document without any official standing.  So it seem
s to me that, as I said on previous occasions, 
that it™s unfortunate that it™s been around as long as it has.  Because it seems to me it™s bound to 
be an embarrassing document at some time and in some circumstances.  And I happen also to 

share John™s feeling, that it™s not particularly useful, especially when its cost is compared to its 
usefulness.   With respect to the two documents, which are re
ferred to in the staff 
memo, I concur with 
the proposal to expand the Record of Policy Actions.  I am uneasy, however, with the idea or the 
proposal that we continue to produce two separate documents which 
profess to record the actions and deliberations of this body.  Most groups feel that one documen
t is adequate to record the actions they take in their meetings.  And it se
ems to me that when we produce two documents 
which profess to do that, again we™re opening ourselves to a question as to just what the 
relationship between the two may be and wh
at™s included and what™s not included.   So it seems to me the Memorandum of Discu
ssion should be dispensed with, and I would like to see very serious consideration given to the idea that the Record of Policy Actions be 
incorporated into the Minutes of Actions of the meeting.  And 
that one document should be the 
official record of proceedings of th
e Federal Open Market Committee.   
Now the proposal to place certain items in the 
files, it seems to me, 
is something which in the current environment, where the minutes of mee
tings are likely to be public property rather promptly, does fit logically and conveniently into th
e format as I visualize it.  There, it seems to 
me, we would be obliged to make note in the 
minutes of the meeting that a certain matter was 
considered and for various reasons could not be in the public area, and therefore, appropriate record is noted in the Committee™s files.  That, 
it seems to me, would put us in a more logical, 
reasonable, and defensible position, and it would substantially reduce the total amount of 
expenditure that™s involved in providing a record of the ac
tions of this body. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Would you like to comment on that Mr. Broida? MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, I think that is
 one possible arrangement, but I might point 
out that the Minutes of Actions and the Record of Policy Actions are prepared for two rather 
different purposes.  The Record of Policy Actions is in compliance with a requirement of section 
10 of the Federal Reserve Act that the Board in
clude in its annual report a statement of all 
decisions on open market policy taken by the Co
mmittee, the reasons for them, and the votes on 
them.  And it is confined primarily to polic
y actions, although from time to time we take 
advantage of it to report actions that are of wide public interest, like changes in the guidelines for 
operations in agency issues.   The Minutes of Actions are more pro forma--a
 document which reports all actions of the 
Committee, including all of the routine actions, 
such as approval of the minutes, agreement on 
4/20/76 - 63 - 
    the next meeting, and so forth, and which for the mo
st part are not [of great] public interest.  We 
do not maintain a distribution list; we make th
em available on file downstairs for anybody who 
cares to consult them. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t think you™re giving a convincing answer to Mr. Baughman™s suggestions. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Could I try that suggestion 
another way?  It seems to me you could 
make a case for incorporating the Record of Poli
cy Actions entry by reference into the Minutes of Actions at such time as the policy record en
try was ready.  The two [the Minutes of Actions and the Record of Policy Actions] have different preparation schedules, and because they have different times of preparation, that means they ha
ve different dates of exposure to appeal under the Freedom of Information Act, and even more under the [proposed] Government in the 

Sunshine Act.  Regularly the policy record entry would be ready later than the kind of thing in 
the Minutes of Actions.  But I see no reason why the Minutes of Actions couldn™t incorporate as an appendix or by record the policy record entry for that action a
nd thereby become a consistent 
holdover time.  At the same time offering-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean the Minutes 
of Actions becoming an appendix to the 
Record of Policy Actions? MR. HOLLAND.  No, the other way around. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh. 

MR. HOLLAND.  The other way around. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  So you prepare the minu
tes first, and then sometime later, you 
prepare the policy record and that which is prep
ared later becomes an appendix to that which you 
prepared earlier. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Yes, so you have one record, 
and I believe that would conform with the 
chronology of when the staff would finish it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that is not Mr. Baughman™s 
suggestion.  Mr. Baughman™s 
suggestion is-- MR. BAUGHMAN.  My inclination--I don™t
 know whether you can pull it off or 
not--would be to use the most time-consuming asp
ect--that record which takes the greatest time 
to prepare--as the basis for arguing what the time frame is within
 which we can make available 
to the public the actions of this
 group.  And it seems to me that
 the Record of Policy Actions, which gives the reasons why we reach certain co
nclusions, should be released concurrent with 
the action that is taken and that it sh
ould be a part of the same document. 
MR. HOLLAND.  But Ernie, I don™t believe that™s 
according to the statute.  That is, I think the timing for release, under the Freedom of Inform
ation Act, of each decision has to be justified 
in terms of the content of each decision, so that 
for the minutes--the approval of the minutes at a 
meeting or the setting of the date of the next 
meeting has--once you take 
that decision at this 4/20/76 - 64 - 
    table, it has its own discipline under the Freedom of
 Information Act as to when that must be 
made public. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Is
 that right, Tom? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  That is correct.  The appr
opriate provisional reference is promptly 
available, and I think Governor Holland speaks 
in terms of the Committe
e™s ability, through the Secretary, to produce, perhaps on the afternoon of a meeting, the votes of actions, the date of the 
next meeting, etc.  Whereas, with respect to 
the Record of Policy Actions and the wrap-around language, the time necessary for articulated prepar
ation is necessarily longer.  And thus you™ve 
got maybe 10 to 15 days at minimu
m, longer if necessary, for that. 
MR. BROIDA.  Mr. Chairman, our present prac
tice is that, as soon as we can after the meeting, usually the next day, we place on file do
wnstairs a report of all actions taken by the Committee except the policy actions which ar
e specifically deferred under the rules. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me ask a critical
 question.  Suppose you stop doing that, and waited, let™s say, 30 or 45 days, depending on what rule we adopt.  Let™s say the present rule is 45 days; would you be acting in conformity with
 the law?  That™s th
e critical question. MR. O™CONNELL.  In my judgment, with resp
ect, Mr. Chairman, to the materials now 
presented in the Public Affairs office downstairs, you would not be acting in conformance with 
the law. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, therefore Mr. Baughman™s 
suggestion is out of the window, not because it™s a bad suggestion but be
cause it doesn™t conform to law, period. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I™d just like to
 offer this one further comment, that it™s 
not inconceivable, it seems to me, that we w
ould discover a lag to produce the Record of Policy Actions within a timeframe which would enable
 us to make what I would hope would be a 
cogent argument, that that was the prompt time within the eyes of the law within which to release 

the actions of this body. MR. PARTEE.  A lot less than 30 days-- MR. BAUGHMAN.  Pardon me? 
MR. PARTEE.  That™s got to be a lot less than 30 days. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And it would be hard, particularly if we were to adopt a significantly expanded Record of Policy Actions, to do that in less 
than 30 days.  As it is, we™ll be strained when we put it on the [unintelligible] 
staff.  We have the staff™s judgment that this 
can be done. MR. HOLLAND.  After signing some of the affi
davits I™ve had to sign as to what this Committee does and doesn™t do, and listen to some 
of the trouble that Art and Tom have been 
through, to me it™s very clear that 
courts are going to be inclined, at least the kind of court we™re up against, are going to be inclined on these issues not to regard documents as a whole, but to tell 
4/20/76 - 65 - 
    us to reach into them and pick out what can 
be available on the shorter time schedule.  And I 
think they do that to us in terms of all the product of this Committee.   
It seems to me, therefore, that it™s very wise
 to keep the Record of Policy Actions entry separate, albeit attached as an appendix when it™s
 finally produced.  Because that is the one thing [that] takes some time to work up.  It is someth
ing which I think we can plausibly maintain and 
needs to be reviewed and acted on by the Committ
ee because it™s an endeavor to create--not 
something they™ve said here word for word at th
e table, but a synthesis of views.  I think it™s most likely to be recognized by courts as something that should come back to this Committee at 

its next meeting to look over and say okay, and not
 until then does that exist as an official document.  Before that, it™s staff™s surmise, you know. 
 If we keep that document just that way, it 
seems to me, that kind of delay is likely to be more
 defensible than if we 
put anything else in it.  And I think we can then afford to put all the rest of the stuff in th
e separate minutes to which this 
might later be appendixed.    
And if worse comes to worst, the court might 
force us to release our directive the same 
afternoon.  As it™s now constituted, I believe the proposal before us would even admit to that 
without being a body blow to this Committee.  That 
is, that the directives 
as they are now worded are qualitative and mellifluous, you know--don™t exactly
 tell where the funds rate™s going to go.  
You know, we can honestly say, that is what the Committee adopted today.  The Record of 
Policy Actions entry comes along 30 days later 
and provides the background, and I think that™s the situation in which the Committee might find itsel
f reasonably well postured before a court.  It leaves no role for the Minutes of Actions, which I agree aren™t full enough to satisfy Government 
in the Sunshine but are full enough to be catnip under the Freedom of Information Act.  It looks 
to me like they™ve outliv
ed their usefulness. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  I find it difficult to believe
, when a succeeding record is specific on 
matters which are of interest, that we will be judg
ed to have satisfied the requirements of the law 
by putting out promptly a generalization which no 
one can construe in a meaningful way, when 
people know that the Committee decided what the f
unds rate would be, what the rates of growth of the aggregates would be, but if that [detail] flows along 30 days later-- MR. HOLLAND.  There™s a possibility, Ernie, that
 they might rip that out of us too.  If 
they do, I don™t even think that is an impossible final adjustment to make.  That means, taking 
what™s now the specification 
sheet and putting all those numbe
rs with a few qualifying and modifying words around them in th
e directive, as we were talking about this morning, and letting 
that go out and then putting all the expanded reasoning and discussion of the economic situation 
out in the Record of Policy Actions entry later.   
You may not want to start with 
that at the moment, but I thin
k that even if you get driven to that, it is not an impossible world to live 
in, particularly if the Committee expresses its 
operating instruments--if you forgive the plug--in
 terms of reserve objectives with a federal 
funds range.  So the market doesn™t get a federal 
funds target that the Committee is aiming at but 
rather a range within which open market
 operations are supposed to live.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Jackson now, please. 4/20/76 - 66 - 
    MR. JACKSON.  Just let me be sure I understa
nd what counsel is advising us.  If the Committee decided to go to a set of minutes
 in the normal customary style that most 
organizations operate, wherein minutes are not 
final until approved at the succeeding meeting, 
it™s your judgment that the Gove
rnment in the Sunshine Act or Freedom of Information Act 
would require disclosure of those minutes prior to the time they 
were approved at the subsequent meeting. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  No sir.  No
r, I hope, have I said that. MR. JACKSON.  Maybe I missed the point, be
cause it strikes me, Mr. Chairman, that 
perhaps Mr. Baughman™s suggestion has merit:  Th
at we adopt one set of minutes for this 
organization, and it includes all the things we have decided to do, but the actual verbiage of those decisions as they would rest in the permanent 
Record of Policy Actions of this organization would not be approved until the subsequent mee
ting, and after that subsequent meeting, they 
would be disclosed. MR. O™CONNELL.  If prior to the close of t
oday™s meeting it was agreed by vote of this 
Committee that the next meeting of the Co
mmittee would be May 18--so voted--Judge Waddy 
would say, ﬁWas it agreed and did the Committee dire
ct that the next meeting would be May 18?  
Yes.ﬂ  That fact is to be di
sclosed on Wednesday [the day af
ter today™s meeting].  So we™re distinguishing, Governor, the list of actions taken [on one hand] from minutes of actions in 
which you have a descriptive or a narrative text that has to be read and approved [on the other hand].  The latter [is released] only when it is approved.  The other--individual acti
ons taken that can be identified in a list of actions--that™s what
™s promptly made available.  Am I correct or not? 
MR. BROIDA.  Yes. 

MR. JACKSON.  Then my suggestion won™t work. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  While I like Mr. Baughman™s suggestion, I would like it [more] if 
our attorneys indicated that it would be conformative to law.
  I don™t see any significant additional faults in having two documents 
instead of just one.  Am I wrong on that? 
MR. BROIDA.  No sir, Mr. Chairman.  I think there might be some positives--that you 
would not want to encumber the Record of Policy Actions with a lot of pro forma actions.  The 
cost goes the other way, of combining them-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  In other words, the amount of trouble to which the staff would 
have to go to would be much the same one way or
 the other way.  And therefore, this can™t be a matter of very large importance to us. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Holland™s suggestion seems to me a very neat way 
of handling the problem, in making the Record of Policy Actions an appendix to the formal 

minutes. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that indeed could be done, and all that means is you add one 
word to the Record of Policy Actions --you write ﬁAppendixﬂ at the top.  Any other comment on 
the Memorandum of Discussion? 
4/20/76 - 67 - 
    MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I™d like to suppor
t two of your recommendations despite the 
fact that I was a member of the subcommitt
ee that came up with the other recommendation 
earlier that we--  
SPEAKER(?).  We were divided equally on that, Bob. 

MR. MAYO.  Well, no, I don™t think we were, 
really, not on the 30 days.  I™m talking 
about the Coldwell subcommittee more recently.  
I have no question at all about the 30-day 
thing.  I think that should be done in any event.  My only question on the other is the acute question of psychology of the timi
ng, whether we appear to be destroying records rather than enhancing public records.  And I think this is a real source of criticism, but despite that, my only 
question in my own mind is whether I would appr
ove this time or wait one more month and then 
approve it.  I think it narrows itself pretty much to that sort of position. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. MacLaury. 

MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your recommendation.  Before I 
came down I had some nostalgia for the Memora
ndum of Discussion, but I haven™t read the 
memorandum.  I think it™s a very 
reasonable kind of suggestion. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Willis, please. 

MR. WINN.  As a random member
, nostalgia doesn™t enter my mind in th
is regard, but-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  There™s still room 
for narcissism, looking for the future. 
MR. WINN.  --but I have in recent years 
been involved with people who have this obsession for sunshine phenomena of various sorts. 
 And I would think that in this discussion, we seem to be intermingling certain fa
ctors that I don™t really feel follow each other.  If we are doing this with the hope of convincing those people who are forcing us in this direction that we are really complying with their wish
es, I don™t think that those individuals will ever be convinced unless we invite them to sit around this table a
nd to be with us 24 hours a day.  I don™t think we would achieve the public relations or the convincing part with these individuals by doing this.   It seems to me also that while the Government
 in the Sunshine bill is in the works, we don™t know how that legislation will come out.  We th
ink that it may pass in its present state.  We 
also are not sure, if I understood Tom correctly, that it would appl
y to this group.  That isn™t a certain fact as yet.  We still ha
ve the litigation pending.  We still are not certain what the ultimate 
decision of the court or courts, if we appeal it, will be.   Unless we™re doing this for the sake of reducing the expenditure of time and the burden on 
our staff for the immediate foreseeable future, or 
unless this has a bearing on the litigation that is 
presently pending, I think that we™re being somewh
at premature.  I think we might be causing 
waves, creating with the best of intentions a reaction that is just the opposite from what we 
would hope for in the minds of the people that 
are driving toward this total disclosure.   And I think that unless there is an operational [reason], or cost, or politically good reason to move now, I would think that it would be 
wiser to wait and see what comes out of the 
4/20/76 - 68 - 
    Congress, what comes out of the courts, and not 
do something that we may have to undo because 
it™s misinterpreted by the very
 people that we™re trying to pacify by this action. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there is a cost, a hea
vy cost, a pretty cost 
to our senior staff, and while I will never ask this Committee to cut 
down on my own labors--that™s something that I 
should be able to control myself, one way or the other.  It™s been a pretty sizable burden in my 
own case recently; more important work had to be se
t aside.  So there is a burden, there is a cost right now. MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, may I be perm
itted to address one of the issues raised 
by Mr. Roos?  In terms of the 
litigation, Mr. Chairman, I believe
 it would be in the Committee™s 
best interest, if your other considerations can tolerate it, if the Chairman were to perhaps position 
this as being before the Committee as a matte
r of principle, thus permitting the Committee™s 
counsel, with your direction and permission, to ma
ke known to the Department of Justice the 
adoption of this intended action as a matter of considered principle.   
I think in the Committee™s intere
st I should discuss with the Department [of Justice] any 
objection they might have to an immediate act
ion that does away with the Memorandum [of 
Discussion], particularly in the light of the appeal, Mr. Chairman.  
I don™t bring this up as a last-minute matter, but further discussion with th
e Department could have bearing on what the 
Committee might want to do in terms in timing.  
If the Chairman and the Committee can tolerate 
that deferment, I think it would be in th
e Committee™s interest to allow me to do so. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I have no difficulty with the suggestion that you make.  I™m 
not sure what it involves, but proceeding deliberately is somethi
ng that I instinctively have a preference for, and therefore, let me modify my 
original suggestion to the Committee.  And that 
is that we vote today not on abandoning the Memorandum of Discussion, but that we vote today 
in principle to do that, with the precise timing, et
c., and final action to be taken at a later time. 
MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, woul
d that leave leeway to reve
rse that if, after further 
deliberation, it was decided to be not in our interest? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s right.  Voting in principle means that final action has not 
yet been taken. MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, I would hope, after 
listening to this discussion, that whatever action may be taken today, it is on the basis 
of weighing off the Memorandum of Discussion 
against the Record of Policy Acti
ons as to which of those would best serve the public and the nation.  I would hope that we wouldn™t make that
 kind of a decision based upon the lawsuit that is now pending.   The reason I say that is, I understand your statement as to time, 
but this lawsuit is one in which there will either be an appeal taken 
very soon by this Committee, I should hope, and a 
final decision as to what we have to release; or, in the alternative, I don™t see that we™ll be plagued with having to go through the same proce
ss that you have had to go through with the Secretary and General Counsel week
 after week.  Therefore, I™d like to separate the decision.  If the Memorandum of Discussion should be done away
 with and there would be better service by preparing a record, as has been suggested, I™d like the vote be taken on that principle alone. 4/20/76 - 69 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, as far as an 
expanded Record of Policy Actions is concerned, one that would set forth the flavor of our debate and the reasons for the decisions that we take, I don™t see how there can be any quest
ion but that it would serve the public interest better than it does at present.  You have the Record of Policy Actions, which is an abbreviated policy record--the kind that we have--plus the Memorandum of Discussion.  But the 
Memorandum of Discussion is not used by the p
ublic.  It is unknown to the public, unknown to the newspapermen, even.  Now, according to Jo
e Coyne, if I understood him correctly, he could 
recall only one instance in which a si
ngle newspaperman referred to it. 
MR. COYNE.  That™s correct. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  So, on that issue, I don™t see that there is any room for debate.  The public would be informed currently to a mu
ch fuller degree.  Now, one could have an expanded Record of Policy Actions and also a Memorandum of Discussi
on, that™s true.  But what the point of that may be, I don™t know
.  The Memorandum of Discussion is proving 
troublesome, and it may prove increasingly troublesom
e in the course of time in view of the 
national legislative and judicial trends. MR. ROOS.  Just to express my own view on th
e issue, as I hope I 
framed it, I would opt 
to do away with the Memorandum of Discussi
on, because it means nothing to me as a new 
member, I guess.  And it would be appropriate 
to have an expanded Record of Policy Actions, which I think would serve very well.  Of course, whether it is released within 30 days or 45 days 
is another issue. MR. HOLLAND.  I think the Committee should be prepared to hear a complaint from an occasional economic historian.  This Committee ha
d a consultant group of economic historians a 
number of years ago to look in
to this and they praised the fullness of this Memorandum of 
Discussion.  It is well nigh unique in the annals of government.  But they themselves used it only 
very rarely, and that™s kind of a small voice, and I believe what we
™re facing here is an issue of, in effect, current information against the matter 
of [unintelligible].  An expanded Record of Policy Actions I believe is sufficient. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  When you come to historians, they™d want us to save all these 
worksheets. 
MR. HOLLAND.  Yes, that™s right. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Literally. 

MR. HOLLAND.  Their report to this Committ
ee was, wait longer and put out more.  And 
I believe that that is literally outdated in terms of the sense of pub
lic purpose that™s in the country today, and we have to recognize it. MR. JACKSON.  Well, if we eliminate the 
Memorandum of Discussion, that would give 
some member of the Committee th
e opportunity someday to presen
t an oral history at some 
university that would bring great credit to that individual, whereas the Memorandum of 
Discussion denies him that opportunity. 
4/20/76 - 70 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You can think some nasty thoughts. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, there is a questi
on whether in lieu of a Memorandum of 
Discussion one should try to invite visiting scholars to work on the history of the Federal Reserve and [unintelligible]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know I have been talking--well you know, I talk, talk, talk, and it™s hard to find someone who listens. 
 I™ve been talking to Allison for some time now, 
to hire an economic historian 
and to have one on the staff.  An economic historian, one who 
would keep track not only of our [failures] but also who could advise of historical questions that keep occurring.  I don™t remember
 talking to you about that, Bob. MR. HOLLAND.  I think that was after my time when you started raising that question. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but you have certain administrative authority at the Board, 
let that be one of your legacies to the Board, to find that historian. MR. HOLLAND.  I shall make provisions for it. 

SPEAKER(?).  I nominate George Garvey. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, if George had the strength, he™d be an ideal man.  George 
Garvey was an economist in the New York Bank for many years.   
Well, gentlemen, would you like to discu
ss further, or is a vote in order? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I ju
st want to clarify one point.  I think it™s the whole thrust of this when you talk about 30 days--we mean after the following meeting. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we take it up separately. 

MR. BROIDA.  It™s in two parts. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Two parts.  First, on the Memorandum of Discussion, the motion 
would be that we agree in principle to substitute an expanded Record of Policy Actions, as suggested by the staff, for the Memorandum of Disc
ussion.  This is to agree in principle that we do that, with the time for final action and tim
e for implementation to be decided later. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  And may I suggest Mr. 
Chairman, without explanation, would you 
care to ask for a show of hands on this? MR. COLDWELL.  I™m not going to
 agree on that.  Well, this 
is going to be action of the Committee for a vote. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  All right th
en, with the understanding that it would be published tomorrow. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  With the understandi
ng that it would be published tomorrow, 
I--well-- 4/20/76 - 71 - 
    MR. HOLLAND.  I recommend the Chairman sample his consensus in whatever way he 
can for a vote. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think I have to be guided by our attorney, and therefore, I™m going to seek a show of hands on a consensus on the--you can™t call it a mo
tion--on the statement 
that I just put before the Committee.  Let™s have 
a show of hands in favor.  Just the members of 
the Committee. 
MR. BROIDA.  Ten, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, now, let™s turn to the second question, and would you state now your specific question. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.    In terms of this
 talking in general of 30 days, in reading your memorandum, you meant after the following m
eeting, which typically, or often, is more 
than 30 days. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think we ought to again express a consensus, if there is a consensus, on a point of principle.  And I w
ould describe that as cutting the period from approximately 45 days to approximately 30 days.  
I want to leave that vague because I™ve been 
having discussions with the staff, and there are some fine points of
 detail, you see, as to whether you release on a Friday or on a Thursday, and I don™t think those points of detail are going to 
matter much to the members of the Committee, but
 they do matter much to our attorneys and to 
Joe Coyne.  And therefore, I don™t think we ought to try to go beyond an enunciation of principle. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And at the level of principle, do you find objectionable the principle that it would be released as soon as possible or as soon as feasible following the next meeting? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t know that I 
necessarily want to tie it to the next 
meeting.  Approximately 30 days--it would work 
out in that fashion, and I think there are good arguments for doing it after the next meeting.  Ha
ving a vote at the next meeting and then early 
release. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,
 that™s what I would think would be natural.  But in 
the substantive--  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think that
™s all right.  I think that™s all right.  But I just would prefer not to have that worked out in detail.  Now that can come back to the Committee, the 
detail you see.  After it™s been thought through by the staff fully and that is not the 
[unintelligible] times. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let 
me just make my substantive point.  It seems to me 
it would be a bit of a confusion to have this record of the past actions coming just before the 
Committee is meeting again.  It kind of gets pe
ople excited about what last month™s policy was 
on the eve of the new policy. 4/20/76 - 72 - 
    MR. COLDWELL.  I have the opposite
 idea.  That it would be worse to bring it out after 
the next meeting. 
MR. HOLLAND.  I don™t think there™s any question but what we get some market 
advantages in terms of working this around one way 
or another.  But it also has to be done for reasons that are plausible to the court, I think, given the kind of stuff we™re up against.  We 
haven™t been very successful thus far in persuading the court that it should account for market 
disruption [arising from] informati
on that is a few days earlier or a few days later.  They have, however, seemed to be quite willing to accept 
the argument [that the information should be 
released] as soon as it was ready.  And if Mr. Broida
 is as artful as usual, it will get ready by the time, I imagine, for the Committee 
to approve it at the meeting, [g
et it] assembled, and get it out 
a day or two after. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, if all we™re 
going to do today--and I think it would be wise to do that and no more--is to reach a consen
sus on principle, then it is not necessary to 
attach a specific interpretation to the phrase appr
oximately 30 days.  This will have to come back 
to the Committee.  And when it comes back to the Committee, and when we take final action, at 

that time we will specify in detail just 
what we mean by approximately 30 days. 
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I have one probl
em, though, of interpreting, even as we 
know it now, approximately 30 days as being 31 to 
38 days, which is really what we™re talking about. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, the changes are what we will be talking about. 

SPEAKER(?).  Yes, and I think 
we would appear to be stretching it if we put 30 days in our consensus. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, under the 31- to 38-day rule, how often would it be 31 days and how often 38? MR. BROIDA.  I think there are four 5-week
 intervals in a year
 and eight 4-week [intervals]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And ther
efore it would be 31 days. MR. BROIDA.  Eight times. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s not too bad, Bob. MR. MAYO.  Well, it™s 
quibbling, I will admit. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Is there possibly another--maybe trivial--point here as to special 
meetings?  It™s conceivable that
 the Committee may meet one week
 after its previous [meeting]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It would work out to 32-1/2 days on the average, and 30 is a good round number for 32-1/2.  [Unintelligibl
e] of what I™ve just been doing. 4/20/76 - 73 - 
    SPEAKER(?).  Are we protected better by le
ss than 40?  Does that look better? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we can decide.  Le
t the vote in principle--vote is not the right word--let the agreement in principle, if we
 are capable of reaching an agreement at this 
hour, let it be simply, we™ve got more work to do, 
gentlemen.  We have to bring this to an end, 
that we decide to reduce the period by somethi
ng like 10 to 15 days.  And that would cover all the sins that have been mentioned at this table.  
And if we find that there are additional sins, then 
we™ll be able to take care of those, I™m sure, at the time when we take final action, if and when 
and as we get to that stage.  Is that all right? 
 Or troublesome?  If not, le
t™s have a show of hands on agreement on principle as just stated. 
MR. BROIDA.  Ten.  I guess it™s unanimous. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, all right now
, I think that we have concluded. MR. COLDWELL.  We™re 
having a sidebar--  MR. JACKSON.  I was just interested in whether he consented to the consensus or not. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think we™ve c
oncluded our meeting as the FOMC. 
END OF MEETING
