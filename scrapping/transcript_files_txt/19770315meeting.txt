March 15, 1977  
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we are read
y to start our meeting.  As you probably 
recall, we hold an organization meeting in March 
of every year, and there is a slate of officers 
which somehow has emerged, and I™ll ask Mr. Broida
 to read the names of
 individuals on that slate.  And after the names have been read, we 
will be ready for a revolution if one member of 
this Committee is in the mood to start it.  Mr. Broida. 
MR. BROIDA.  Chairman, Arthur F. Burns; 
Vice Chairman, Paul A. Volcker; Secretary, 
Arthur Broida; Deputy Secretary, Murray Altmann; Assistant Secretary, Normand R.V. Bernard; 
General Counsel, Thomas J. O™Connell; Deputy 
General Counsel, Edward G. Guy; Assistant General Counsel, Baldwin B. Tuttle; Economist, 
Steven H. Axilrod; Associate Economists from 
the Board Staff:  John E. Reynolds, Joseph S. Zeisel, James L. Kichline, Edwin M. Truman, 
Edward C. Ettin; Associate Economists from the Reserve Banks:  Robert Eisenmenger 

(suggested by Mr. Morris), Richard G. Davis (suggested by Mr. Volcker), Carl Scheld (suggested by Mr. Mayo), Anatol Balbach (suggested by Mr. Roos), and Thomas Davis 
(suggested by Mr. Guffey). 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now you have heard th
e names of the officers as read by Mr. 
Broida.  These are suggestions for the Committee, and any other suggestions or set of 
suggestions will be entertained by the Chair at this
 moment.  And Mr. Lilly is going to start the 
revolution. MR. LILLY.  I would move that the nominations be closed 
and that the Secretary be 
instructed to cast a unanimous ballot fo
r the nominees contained on the slate. 
SPEAKER(?).  Second the motion. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The motion has been ma
de and it has been seconded.  And now ready for discussion.  Any other nominations, any 
dissents?  All in favor will kindly say aye. 
ALL.  Aye. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any opposed?  Next, we 
need to designate one of our Federal 
Reserve Banks to handle the System Open Market 
Account.  And there is another opportunity to start a revolution.  Now, the suggestion has been that the New York Bank might continue to 
perform this function.  Is th
ere a motion to that effect? 
SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been made 
and inaudibly seconded.  Any dissent?   
Very well, now that we know who will handle 
the System Open Market Account, or which 
[Reserve] Bank will handle it, we have to decide on the individuals who will perform the 

necessary functions.  And we need to select a Manager of the System Open Market Account, a 
function presently performed by Mr. Holmes.  
We need to select a Deputy Manager for 3/15/77 - 2 -     Domestic Operations, and the present incumbent 
is Mr. Sternlight.  And we finally need to appoint a Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations, and this function is handled by Mr. Pardee.  And revolution so far has not taken place; here is your final opportunity to start a revolution.  Any suggestion for a change in the officialdom? 
 SPEAKER(?).  [Unintelligible]. 
 SPEAKER(?).  Seconded. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been made
 very audibly that Messrs. Holmes, 
Sternlight, and Pardee be reappointed. MR. JACKSON.  Do we have an indicati
on that they would accept the appointment? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We have no such indication known, but we can proceed and make our decision, and then the individuals involved can make theirs.  
And if there is any dissent?  I 
hear none.   And now we need to act on the minutes on th
e February meeting.  Is there a motion to 
approve? SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been made
 and probably seconded.  And not hearing any objections, we will turn to Mr. Holmes™s report on the foreign currency outlook. 
MR. HOLMES.  [Secretary's note: This statement was not found in Committee records.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  I am a littl
e puzzled by the attitude of the Swiss 
National Bank.  Why did they intervene?  Why di
dn™t they let the Swiss franc decline?  They have been worried for some time.   
MR. HOLMES.  I think it was the extent that 
it was declining on that particular day, Mr. Chairman.  It moved by about 
3/4 percent, as I recall. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What™s wrong with that? 
MR. HOLMES.  Basically, I think the Swiss ar
e completely happy to see the Swiss franc 
depreciate.  But they do believe in orderly markets and wanted their presence felt. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m still puzzled. 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Th
ere™s a bigger drop of the Swiss franc relative to the 
mark.  Considerably bigger than relative to the do
llar.  And it™s their biggest trading partner.  And I think they™re a bit ambivalent.  They wo
rry a bit about inflation.  I don™t think they--I 
don™t get the impression they™re te
rribly unhappy, but they are not entirely happy, either, with it declining too far relative to the mark. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I have been wondering about that. 3/15/77 - 3 - 
    MR. PARDEE.  There is an ambivalence there. 
MR. WALLICH.  Alan, you interp
ret the Swiss franc decline as
 a relaxation of tensions, which seems plausible.  At the same time, we™ve got
 the rising gold price, usually stated to mean 
the opposite--do you see some way of reconciling this? 
MR. HOLMES.  Yes, I would think the rising go
ld price can be explained by two causes.  One, the continued demand from the Mideast and th
e Far East, which is not really affecting any concern about European currencies.  And second, with a rise in industrial production around the world, I think industrial demand for gold has picked up rather 
substantially.  So the market has been able to handle substantial supplies from 
both Russia and South Africa, and sales by other countries, without problems. 
MR. WALLICH.  It looks as though there we
re a solid, nonspeculative [demand] under 
that price. 
MR. HOLMES.  I think it™s partly that, yes. 

MR. MAYO.  Is there any concern, Alan, about the viability of South Africa as a gold 
producer because of their racial problems? 
MR. HOLMES.  Well, from time to time that 
comes up.  But I don™t th
ink that has really been a factor in gold prices.
 MR. PARDEE.  It was reported in the last Basle meeting, though, that 
there has been more investment interest from the United States to 
be seen in the European
 gold market--investor 
interest, whatever that means.  But both
 from the spot and the futures market. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Does it refl
ect also a concern over the cost of production of gold? MR. HOLMES.  Not that I know of.
 MR. COLDWELL.  I have heard 
this--that there is a possibility a few of the mines are 
running into problems, thinner veins, and so forth. 
MR. HOLMES.  But the market really has handled the IMF sales--which they were very 
frightened about when the IMF started--remarkabl
y well.  In fact, the price seems to go up just 
before each auction. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions about Mr. Holmes™s report?  If not, is there a motion to approve transactions of the Desk? MR. COLDWELL.  So moved. 

MR. MAYO.  Seconded. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I take it the motion has been made, s
econded; I hear no dissent.  Do you have any recommendations, Mr. Holmes? 
3/15/77 - 4 - 
    MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, as I said, it 
has been a very dull period, and I have no recommendations at this time.  We do have th
e Swiss franc swap maturing on April 29, but we 
will pay it off before we get there. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, we™ll turn now to the domestic economy.  Mr. Zeisel. 
MR. ZEISEL.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much, 
Mr. Zeisel.  We will hear now from 
members of the Committee.  Mr. Black, please. 
MR. BLACK.  Jerry, I found rather interesti
ng your comments on the outlook for federal 
expenditures, particularly so far as regards the shortfalls we™ve had, and was interested to know that you expect this to continue.  Could you elaborate a little, to the extent that you know, why this has taken place?  I have r
ead everything I can find on it, but I don™t feel like I have a very good handle. MR. ZEISEL.  Well, nobody really does.  The amount
 of the shortfall at this point seems to 
be, including a rough estimate for February, in the $9 [billion] to $10 billion range.  It seems to 

be distributed fairly widely among expenditures categories, in
cluding unemployment insurance, 
Veterans Administration payments, defens
e, and several other categories.   [As to] the ﬁwhy,ﬂ well, there are just conjectures.  It was felt last year that it was sort of a characteristic pattern of government agencies
 anticipating, or putting 
in, a budget item which 
would fully cover what they anticipate their spending to be and then coming in somewhat lower-
-because it looks better to come in somewhat lowe
r, in effect.  I might say that the pattern of 
anticipating higher spending than actually occurs has been characteristic of, oh, possibly the last two decades, and over the last--  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are you sure of that? 
MR. ZEISEL.  Yes, our people tell us that the average spending has gone below the anticipation, as of October in this case, by about
 1 percent on average for about two decades and 
about 2 percent for the last half-dozen years.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™d like to see the full evidence. 
MR. PARTEE.  Probably ranges widely, some
 years below and some years above.  
Because I can certainly remember a period in 
the middle ™60s--they ran consistently above 
estimates. 
MR. ZEISEL.  Yes, there were times when it 
ran above.  But as I recall the figures, there were years and years, many more years, in whic
h spending ran below, than above--over the last decade, roughly.   
I might make an additional comment.  A number
 of these items are not likely to affect 
activity.  They are financial in nature--at least they™re not likely to have an immediate effect on 

activity, such as payments to the Defense Depart
ment by foreign recipients of military hardware, 
3/15/77 - 5 - 
    which is an offset to spending, and there are other such offsets to spending that don™t really have a significant current effect.  The [overestimat
e] of unemployment compensation payments, for 
example, would not be a negative factor in a
ny sense, because that means that they have 
estimated that unemployment would be higher 
than it really turned
 out to be, and if unemployment is lower, presumably people ar
e working, which is a good thing.  The ﬁwhy,ﬂ though, remains still obscure in terms of the volume 
of the shortfall at this point.  We expect 
much of it to be made up in 
the second quarter.  But not all. MR. PARTEE.  Did you say it was $9 [billion] to $10 billion?  Was that for January and 
February? MR. ZEISEL.  That was for February. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I thought it was running around 7. MR. ZEISEL.  I may be wrong, I think the figure 
was 7 in January and an estimate of 9 in 
February.  But that™s roughly-- 
MR. MAYO.  This is cumulative for the year? 

MR. ZEISEL.  That™s a cumulative figure. 

MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I heard a theo
ry yesterday that the new budget procedure may have something to do with this.  That under 
the present system it is more difficult to get 
supplementary budgets through the Congress.  And th
erefore the agency heads tend to put a little more into the budget than they might otherwise ha
ve done.  Whether there™s any validity to that, I don™t know. MR. MAYO.  Well, there™s also been the theo
ry, Mr. Chairman, as you know, that with the 
advent of greater inflation in the last few years, agencies have 
padded their estimates more, just 
as a protective device.  And that all of this hasn™t been wrung out by the executive budget process. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you know, none of this as far as I know has been planned even remotely, but it does put the Administration 
in an ideal political position.  As far as the expansionists are concerned, the Administration coul
d point to its fiscal package, and here is a policy for stimulating our economy by manipulating 
the budget.  As far as the conservatives are concerned, who believe that the spending is much
 too high and the budget deficit is much too large--then one could point to the shortfall.  Here the planned expenditure is not being realized, and all kinds of economies one way or anot
her are accumulating.  I™d
 hate to argue the 
Administration™s position in the Congress, in view 
of the shortfall at the 
present time, but people 
I™ve talked to just don™t know why [it™s] happening.   
Now last year, Mr. Ford was blamed on th
e ground that he was seeking to curb 
expenditures.  Well, Mr. Ford isn™t around to be
 blamed any longer.  And now the finger of 
blame is pointing to a multiplicity of agencies, wh
ich one way or another are not doing their job-
-their job being to spend and keep on spending. 3/15/77 - 6 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  Well, they are paying attenti
on to it, though, Mr. Chairman; there is an 
effort being made to find out w
hy the shortfall.  And I certainly get the impression there™s every intention to try to remedy the situation.  So I think 
the thrust of what Jerry said--that some of the 
shortfall may well be made up in the months to come, and we may well get more strength in 

government spending--is [on] a reasonable basis. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think it is. 

MR. ZEISEL.  Some of the s
hortfall would be made up by legislative increase in the 
expenditures for the second quarter, which in a sense are already built-in by $3 [billion] or 

$3-1/2 billion. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, Mr. Balles, please. 

MR. BALLES.  I™d like to come back to Je
rry™s remarks on productivity and unit labor 
costs and ask him a question.  As I look at the patter
n for last year, it™s somewhat disturbing if it 
were to be continued into this year, in the sense that, quarter-by-quarter last year, the rate of increase of real final sales changed pace as 
the year went along.  Compensation per man-hour 
didn™t really accelerate; it was grow
ing at a lower rate during the la
st three quarters than the first 
quarter.  The quarter-by-quarter ra
te of gain of output per man-
hour went downhill; in fact, in the 
final quarter it actually was negativ
e.  And the net of that was that
 unit labor cost kept gaining in terms of rate of increase, quarte
r-by-quarter; in the fourth quarter, it took quite a sharp jump.  If 
that were to continue, it™d have pretty adverse implications for 1977.  I was wondering, taking this mix of things--[output] per man-hour, comp
ensation against unit labo
r cost--what you see in the tea leaves for 1977. MR. ZEISEL.  Well, the productivity performan
ce, if I may focus on that immediately, is 
very directly related to the weakness in real activity through much of the year.  And typically, except in certain cyclical situations, one doesn™t get good gains in productivity associated with sluggish gains in real output.  And we™re anticipating for 1977 a faster rate of growth in real GNP, in the 6 percent range, and for private output it™s about 6-1/2 percent.  And we feel that this is consistent with a faster rate of productivity gain in 1977 than 1976, by about 1/2 percentage point.  The productivity average for 1976 was 2.8 for the four quarters, and we are projecting about 3-1/3.   In terms of the wage side I™ve expressed myself
 on this earlier.  It™s being optimistic, but it 
seems that there™s really no strong basis for assu
ming a rapid acceleration in wage increases this 
year.  I think that there will be some increase over th
e rate of gain that we had last year.  But in 
general it seems to us that you™re not going to ge
t the kinds of big catch-ups that occurred over 
the last two years, since a much
 larger proportion of the labor force is protected by the cost-of-living clauses--have their wages protected thereby--and you™re not going to get big, first-year increases.  And we see compensation per hour ri
sing on average a little above 8 percent, as opposed to about 7-3/4 percent.   And so this is a standoff, in a sense.  We have the compensation rising slightly faster, the 
productivity rising slightly faster, and our unit labor cost outlook, therefore, is about the same as 
last year.  Which is about a 4-3/4 percent rate of increase. 3/15/77 - 7 - 
    MR. BALLES.  That™s for the year as a whole. MR. ZEISEL.  That™s for four quarters versus four quarters in 1972. MR. BALLES.  Oh, I see. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, Mr. Roos. 
MR. ROOS.  May I borrow Mr. Zeisel?  Do
 you feel comfortable you™ve projected a growth through the four quarters for this year in GNP of about 6-1/4 percent?  And I assume 
that™s predicated on M1 and M2 growth roughly in the middle of the ra
nges that are presently set.  Our evidence indicates that it would be difficult to reach that 
goal.  We show projections of 
maybe 4-1/2 percent GNP growth using our pres
ent midranges, or conversely, having to maybe 
increase growth in M1 and M2 to maybe 7 and 11-1/2 percent to achieve that target--which is, of 
course, the stated target of th
e Administration--unless there is
 exceptionally high growth in velocity.  Do you feel comfortable w
ith that 6-1/4 percent projection? MR. ZEISEL.  Well, I will comment briefly and 
then turn the floor over to Mr. Axilrod for 
his reactions to that.  As you know, our projections are basically judgmental in nature, and the 
translation, therefore, is not a rigorous mathematical translat
ion.  However, we do have an econometric model we use for simulations for th
is purpose, and there does not seem to be 
anything in the econometric fore
cast which would be significantly out of line with the projections that we have prepared judgmentally, that we feel are 
consistent with the M1 growth.  The-- MR. ROOS.  It assumes the rate of growth in 
velocity, which is sort of historically high, isn™t it? 
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, Mr. Axilrod, I think-- 

MR. AXILROD.  Yes, we would have to have a rather substantial growth in velocity over 
the next year.  As you know, in this recovery, we have had periods of very substantial rates of growth of velocity of M1, particularly because 
of the change in financial technology.  We expect 
some of these changes in financ
ial technology to be continuing, but also in addition, as in the Bluebook, we do expect interest rates to rise.  In the past we™ve had these increases in velocity in this recovery without rises in interest rates.  Now this time we believe that there will be actually 
some rise in interest rates acco
mpanying a rise in velocity.   
We™ve checked it out against econometric models we have at 
hand.  And our interest rate forecast and our velocity forecast are consistent
 with the models, after you allow for the mis-
estimates that the models have been consistent
ly making for the past two years.  And allowing 
for those mis-estimates--that is, correcting the mo
del by hand for the same mistake it made last 
year--you would end up roughly with the velocity and interest rate forecasts that are implicit in our projections.  Now that may be cold comfort, 
as I have as little fait
h in the pure accuracy of models as maybe you do, but at least it double checks it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Mr. Baughman, may we hear from you now. 
3/15/77 - 8 - 
    MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I have heard some rumblings in recent weeks as 
people apparently are beginning to discover that, with the change in ta
x laws, they cannot use certain benefits under drilling and exploratory work as offsets against other income to the extent 
that they could previously.  This is generally described as, in effect, a 15 percent increase in 
income tax.  The data on drilling activities, 
however, indicate a continued and rising level of activity.  Unfortunately the production figures don™t indicate the turnaround in the trend there, however.   One other thing that™s been reported recen
tly is a McGraw-Hill report on plans for investment in new manufacturing 
capacity extending over the next three years, and those figures show a rather spectacular prospect for Texas, with a total which exceeds the 
sum of the next five 
states in line--that is, with Texas having the 
largest amount and exceeding the sum of the next 
five. MR. PARTEE.  In total manufacturing. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  For new manufacturing capac
ity.  I would assume there is no reason 
for expecting those to be realize
d, but they do indicate what present 
thinking and intentions are.   And then it occurred to me that
, just to avoid the impression 
that Texas is a one-industry or one activity-center state, I possibly should report that their 18th annual rattlesnake hunt was carried off successfully last weekend in the Swee
twater area, and this weekend in a community 
called Luckenbach, with a population of three, that they will celebrate the annual return of the mud daubers.  You ask, Mr. Chairman, ﬁWhat™s a 
mud dauber?ﬂ  A mud dauber is described as a 
Texas-size, wasp-like insect that makes it™s nest out of mud and does an awful lot of buzzing.  
But you don™t have those in New England. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it™s
 clear that Texas is doing well.  [Does] any member of 
our group differ at all basically from Mr. Zeisel™s exposition? 
MR. BALLES.  I guess we do in San Francisco, Mr. Chairman.  In tracking down the 
somewhat less optimistic forecast that we have on
 real GNP--for example, the Board staff has 5 
percent year-over-year, we have 4.3; Board staff has 6.2 percent gain fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter and we have only 5.5--it appears that our staff is apparently assuming less stimulus from 
the Carter fiscal package then you are here, Jerry.  If I remember the numbers right, and I hope 
that I do, my staff is guessing that only about 
1/3 of the $50 rebate would flow immediately 
through to consumer spending, and I 
gather that your estimates are 
somewhat higher than that.  Is 
that correct? 
MR. ZEISEL.  No, they™re not [higher].  Our estimates are actually a bit lower.  The 
immediate spending of the rebates--we estimate th
at it™s about 20 to 25 percent, cumulating to a 
total of only about 1/3 by the end of the year.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, currently the two 
staffs diverge, and my own thinking is 
very close to the thinking of our staff, but as far as the fiscal package is conc
erned, I don™t think it is going to make any differe
nce one way or another as far as the real economy goes.  But 
whatever positive influence comes from a little larg
er spending will be offset by higher interest 
rates and inflation fears.  So th
ere are differences between our sta
ffs, and I am not sure to what 
3/15/77 - 9 - 
    degree they are attributable to differences in estimates of what th
e fiscal package is going to do.  And my reason for making this statement is that I 
think it™s a little dangerous to assume that the 
fiscal package will necessarily prove beneficial to
 any degree.  In any case, there is a contrary 
view, and I have just voiced it.  Any other opinions?  Ye
s, Mr. Volcker. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I 
might just note, Mr. Chairman, that our projections, 
prepared at the New York Bank, track the Board™s projections so closely that I suspect collusion.  Except, fortunately, the pattern changes a bit through the year as whole.  They come up to the 
same tenth of a point on both the real growth 
and the prices, and there™s something the matter 
there, there must be something-- 
MR. ZEISEL.  Cut the telephone lines between them. 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Th
e pattern is somewhat different in that we show a 
slightly more rapid growth in the second quarter 
and the third quarter, and then it tapers off in late ™77 into ™78.   The point I want to make is th
at the analysis suggests somewh
at more pressure on interest 
rates, I think, than is suggested by the remarks 
that were just made a
nd the discussion in the Greenbook.  Now these [projections] have been notoriously bad in the past year, and I am very 
conscious of that, but I do think this is the pr
oblem we may be facing dur
ing the year with more- 
optimistic economic projections.  And my sense of 
it is that the Board staff™s analysis leans on the side of moderation here.  It may underestimat
e the kind of dilemma we have between holding 
our aggregate figures and interest rates as the year unfolds.  I hope that™s not the case, but I have a little feeling that we do face 
that risk in perhaps more pointed fashion than our analysis 
suggests. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Mr. Lilly now, please. MR. LILLY.  Well, I have a li
ttle concern, Jerry, with your projection regarding chemicals and the primary metals and other in
dustrial materials.  I think the 
last couple of weeks there has been a substantial pushing up of prices in this area, and I am wondering if we are giving 
sufficient attention to it, because this could be 
the precursor of rather substantial increases in 
prices all the way throug
h the manufacturing sector. 
MR. ZEISEL.  We have been very concerned 
with the increase in commodities prices, 
Governor Lilly.  There has been a range of increases among nonferrous metals; lumber, which 
has edged off a bit.  A number of food and related items--all rather special situations, such as the 
coffee price run-up.  But as far as the metals [are concerned], for example, we™ve been 
concerned.  It seems to have been an unreasonable so
rt of increase, except 
to the extent that the 
prices on a number of these commodities had dro
pped rather sharply earlier, and this would appear to be an attempt on the part of these manu
facturers to recover profit margins.  If that™s the 
case, and we feel that it probably is, it may not be a harbinger of c
ontinued increases, particularly since demands are really not that intense worldwide. 
MR. LILLY.  Well, I am concerned that it may 
be the beginning of a trend rather than an episode of it. 3/15/77 - 10 - 
    MR. ZEISEL.  It certainly has bad psychological implications, and we will be monitoring 
this very carefully. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, ne
xt.  Mr. Eastburn, please. MR. EASTBURN.  I want to give some support to Governor Lilly™s comment on 
chemicals.  One of our directors is in the ch
emical business, and he was extremely bullish the 
last time we had a go-around in our-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Because prices would be rising? 
MR. EASTBURN.  Well, the volum
e of business he said was very strong, and then he expressed some concern a
bout the price situation. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have a note before me
 from a member of our staff which reads 
ﬁmany chemical prices are scheduled
 to be raised in the second quarter.ﬂ  What the basis for that report is, I don™t know. MR. LILLY.  I think increase in demand. 
MR. PARTEE.  They™ve had annual increases. 
MR. JACKSON.  They™ve had a good bit of cost pressure and relatively little price relief 
from it. 
MR. EASTBURN.  One difference between our projections and the Board™s, particularly with respect to the unemployment rates--the Gr
eenbook has this about a half percentage point lower than ours by the end of the year.  Now this is partly because you have greater strength in the economy than we do, which is attributable larg
ely to the capital goods sector.  And also this is my question having to do with 
the anticipated growth in the la
bor force, which is slower in your case than it is in ours.  It has been very strong, of course, and I just wondered if you have some basis for slowing down the labor force growth. 
MR. ZEISEL.  The labor force growth that we have
 projected is still fairly substantial.  It™s 2 million, roughly, and involves a steady increase in the 
participation rate.  It is not as rapid as 
the increase that we had in 1976, and we feel the major factor there is th
at the pressures from 
price increases and declines in real family inco
me are not as intense as they were.  They had pushed a lot of women, a lot of seco
ndary workers, into the labor mark
et at that point.  As so we feel that [given] an easing of this particular 
pressure [because of] rising real incomes, we will 
move back toward a more reasonable 
rate of growth in the labor force. MR. EASTBURN.  And what follows, I suppose, is that, if you are underestimating price 
increases, this could have an upsetting effect on your labor force projections. MR. ZEISEL.  It could, yes. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Partee, please. 3/15/77 - 11 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  Well I, of course, don™t have 
a projection of the economy, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You say you do not? 
MR. PARTEE.  Oh no, just hunches, and I wa
nt to share both Governor Lilly™s and 
President Volcker™s concerns.  As far as the 
physical side is concerned, it seems to me the 
outlook is very good.  In fact, I could make a 
case that it could be stronger than the staff 
projection in the immedi
ate quarters ahead.  Not in the second [quarter] so much--you™ve had 8 
percent already there, but in 
the third and perhaps the fourth, based on a real recovery in investment expenditures, which I 
think is probably in process now, and also a larger amount of inventory accumulation, than you have in the proj
ection.  So I think the real activity outlook is quite strong.   But as to prices, I must say that I find myself
 doubtful that the rate of inflation is going to subside, as in the projection, to 5-1/4 percent, partly because I think food prices may go up more 
rapidly than you are still allowing.  And also part
ly because of Governor Lilly™s concern about 
industrial materials and the kinds of tensions that may occur there.  You have already, in the last 
four weeks, raised the nominal GNP projection by
 1/2 point--a quarter percent real and a quarter 
percent price.  You™ve got 8--even a little more real than that
--and if you have more price than 
that, it really begins to put pressure on the financial system.  And 
I think interest rates could rise significantly more than is now be
ing projected, and that, of course, will have its GNP impact not 
so much this year but in 1978, which I think 
does make a case for a different profile.   
Looking out further ahead than you have, Jerry, in your comments, along the lines that 
President Volcker was mentioning, I don™t really 
know what we can do about this, because the 
interest rate effect will come if, in fact, we 
have this kind of inflationary development and 
inflationary expectation.  And I suppose in the short run almost everybody would be happy to see 
stronger real growth in the economy.  But I, 
like President Volcker, see some difficulty in 
financial markets as we get to the end of the 
year, and difficulty in markets which are greatly 
affected by credit costs as we go into 1978--such as housing. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would lik
e to amplify Governor Partee™s comments on prices.  In 
the past four months, the price of cocoa has rise
n 40 percent, the price of coffee 82 percent, the 
price of orange juice 66 percent, soybeans 27 percent.  An average for metals prices is up 17 
percent, hides and rubber prices average up 17-1/2 percent, lumber and plywood prices up 11 to 12 percent, fuel oil and gasoline up 8-1/2 percent.  The increases have been rather large and spreading. MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman in those lumber figures, I think maybe even that™s 
conservative according to some of the builder
s, because they are almost quoting a $1,000 
addition to the price of lumber in the average 
home in our area at the moment.  So just the 
lumber alone is becoming a substantial dete
rrent in cost--particularly in houses. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr
. Chairman, if I may just chime in on this again, 
briefly.  I reported that our price projections were the same as the Board™s, but I also want to 
report on qualitative evidence.  
The kind of noise we are getting from the business community-- 
certainly somewhat to my surprise, I guess, an
d maybe it shouldn™t have been--is louder and 
3/15/77 - 12 - 
    shriller about price increases than I can recall at any time during this expansion.  It™s partly 
reflecting this commodity business, but not just th
at.  [There is a] kind of a feeling [that] the better market is coming and the opportunity [is co
ming] to raise profit margins once again.  Now 
they have been talking about this, of course, before, but I am 
somewhat taken aback with the 
strength with which I have heard these sounds in the past month or 45 days. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  To what degree are businessmen concerned or somewhat nervous 
about the prospect of governmental controls 
over prices?  Do you hear
 much about that?  
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™ve heard less of that just recently. 
MR. MAYO.  I think it™s faded, Mr. Chairman. 

MR. KIMBREL.  I™m not sure we can say th
at, Mr. Chairman, because every time the 
Administration says that [they] ar
e not interested, it surfaces again.  So if they™d just quit saying ﬁwe are concerned,ﬂ I think it will settle back down.  But ﬁthe louder thou persistethﬂ--it seems 
to be coming through to the businessmen. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Winn, we are 
ready to hear from you now, please. MR. WINN.  Two or three points, Mr. Chairman.  
First, in terms of prices, particularly in 
the building materials area, I just
 call your attention [to the fact] that home modernization repairs 
are estimated to exceed new building costs this year. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean total outlay on buildings? 

MR. WINN.  That absorbs building materials and 
workers.  That™s really getting to be a very sensational-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are you talking about the residential? MR. WINN.  Yes.  The second point I™d make
 is that the psychological impact of the 
second quarter sales are likely to be quite bullish in view of last year™s second quarter sales.  But people don™t always recognize that the downturn occurred in the second quarter last year, and then they get these sensational figures this year to get a real buildup. MR. PARTEE.  Year-over-year? MR. WINN.  That™s correct.  Now, [number] 
three--the interesting price phenomenon has 
been the oil-based chemicals, [which] have been weak in price, and this has been a puzzle and 

may come back quite strong in view 
of oil costs, for basic stock.   In a quite a different vein, Mr. Chairman, I ha
ve been spending some time talking to low-
income people, and the underlying rage in that ar
ea is troublesome.  I don™
t think it™s purely the outbreak both here in Washington and in Clevel
and recently, but these pe
ople are faced with, oh, a 40 percent increase in their rent, and their en
ergy cost now exceeds their rental cost.  Now, 
food costs are really [taking a toll], in terms 
of this group.  In addition to that, we have a phenomenon of a cutback in governmental services to
 these people as a result of budget restraint.   3/15/77 - 13 - 
    [There is] a great deal of unde
rlying unrest in terms of desegr
egation school efforts in a whole host of communities.  And I don™t know wh
ether we™re going to have to go to energy stamps or some effort of this kind, but I am 
recognizing in history that revolutions occur only when conditions are improving.  The feeling of bei
ng left out is stronger than I have seen in a long period of time.  This troubles me.  It in no 
way depreciates the idea of the strength of the economy, but there is a group being left out, a
nd they are bitter, and this worries me. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I have been getting a good deal of mail from apparently 
lower-income people who are only semiliterate but 
who know that the subs
tantial increase in congressional salaries has recently occurred, and they are quite bitter about that.  More bitter mail like that than I have seen in quite a long time. 
MR. BLACK.  Are any of these letters commending us for our actions, Mr. Chairman? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh, there have been many, oh yes, though some blame the Federal 
Reserve Board for not stopping the increase in congr
essional salaries.  Governor Wallich, please. 
MR. WALLICH.  I wonder whether we™d be he
lped in looking at the price situation by distinguishing between the macro and micro elem
ents.  I think our discussion has been in good part on micro aspects--particular prices, particular 
sectors.  And while, in the past, I have always heard industry people predominately talk about 
the absence of [macro-type] pressures, the conversation here has been predominately focusi
ng on where there are pressures.  I find myself 
somewhat confused.   
What I am going to ask you is, [what weight do 
these] two elements carry in your forecast?  
We have capacity, which I think is less large than most people think at 
the present time, [but] 
nevertheless, it is substantial.  There are wage 
increases, and they do not seem to be accelerating 
significantly.  There is monetary 
and fiscal policy.  Monetary policy, I think, one can hardly say is excessively stimulatory.  Fis
cal policy has a question mark.  On
 the whole, I would look at the macro variables as being more nearly
 on the side of a slow rate of increase in prices.  The micro I 
have a difficulty in telling.  What is the wei
ght that you would attach to these things, Jerry? MR. ZEISEL.  Well, like you, my contact with
 businessmen has not suggested any great 
concern during 1977, at least.  The possibility of impinging upon capacity--[there has been] some 
talk that that may occur in 1978, if
 things continue at a vigorous pace in selected industries.  So 
that has not been a major concern here.   
In terms of macro policy--I assume fiscal pol
icy--I assume you mean those components of 
policy that are generating or helping to generate a given rate of growth from the economy--is that the point you have in mind, Governor?  With the 
first point, the rate of increase in real GNP growth that we have projected is somewhat greater than the increa
se in capacity that appears to 
be on stream, which is somewhere between 4 and 5 percent.  So we will be moving back toward 

the capacity line, but we would be moving at a rather moderate pace
.  In our projections, it isn™t until mid-™78 that we begin to get to a point wi
th capacity utilization fo
r either materials or 
manufacturing that we may begin to
 see any significant bottlenecks, even in selected areas.  And 
in macro terms we would still be well below the poten
tial rate of growth.  That™s not a substantial factor.   3/15/77 - 14 - 
    I think the concerns that we have relate to the shorter run, that is, in ™77--a worry about inflation and its psychological impact and an aggravation of inflationary anticipation.  There are implications both for inflation itself and for attitu
des of business and consumers.  For ™78, we see 
these situations beginning to possibly concern specific areas. MR. PARTEE.  Are there a lot of wage contracts in ™78? 
MR. ZEISEL.  This is a big year, so ™78 should be a small year. 
 This year is bigger than last year.  It™s about 4-3/4 million, and last year 
it was a little over 4, and then it™s a three-year 
cycle--pretty much standard. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I do want to say a word about the macro side.  For the past 
twelve months, M2 has risen by 10-1/2 percent a
nd M3 by 12-1/2 percent.  These figures hardly suggest a policy of strong monetary
 restraint.  On the fiscal side, we are continuing to run large deficits, and the prospect is that these deficits will increase.  And that undoubtedly is not only [a] 
situation [of] so much more money being put into
 the pockets of people than is being withdrawn from the pockets of people, but [it] is having [a
] large psychological effect on our people across the land.  Yes,  Mr. Partee. MR. PARTEE.  Could I just say to Governor Wallich, it is a question of confidence in the economy aside from governmental policy.  And I 
do feel that one thing that hasn™t been mentioned that ought to be mentioned is that I 
think the confidence in the economy is increasing 
rather rapidly, and in particular, confidence in the new Administration is at
 this point quite high.  The surveys show it--a very high proportion of the public approves of the way the President is 
doing his job at this point.  And I really do think that™s a new 
factor that needs to be mentioned, 
and that in itself could lead to a stronger business rise if it™s not upset.  And in coming months, 
then one would just argue on the basis of past relationships in macro/micro stimulation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Morris, please. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to
 follow up on Governor Partee™s question and ask, in terms of your flow of funds work, what
 is the implication of 
this projection for the flow of funds, particularly the external corporate demand for m
onies?  What does that tell us 
about the likely behavior of interest rates? MR. AXILROD.  President Morris we continue to have no greater external demand for 
funds by corporations projected for 1977 than we have for 1976.  In 1976, corporations were net 
borrowers, that is, in net assets less liabilities, they were net borrowers of around $25 billion in financial markets.  This compared, say, with $70 
billion in ™74, and we were projecting for ™77 a very similar number--in fact, almost exactly the 
same--and with very little uptrend in the course 
of the year.  And, of course, we have large profit flow and an increase in plant and equipment 
spending, but not of boom proportions.   So from that point of view, you don™t have 
a factor which is adding to credit market 
pressures as compared with the previous year.  
That has been one of the factors that has kept--
me, at least--thinking that inte
rest rate pressures, viewed from credit demand and supplies--not 
just from velocity but from the markets 
themselves--are not extremely intense.   
3/15/77 - 15 - 
    Now, we have projected a rather
 substantial rise in interest rates, I might add, a bill rate 
going around 4-1/2 to 7 by early ™78--in a period when price pressures aren™t intensifying.  That™s a rather substantial rise in interest rates for such a period. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Steve, to what extent are your flow of funds projections integrated with your overall economic projections? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, we hope they™re fully 
integrated--they™re integrated with the Bluebook, and they™re integrated with the housing starts and plant and equipment numbers that 
come from the economic projection. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, does that mean 
that your flow of funds projections are revised every month? 
MR. AXILROD.  Yes, they are. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t see them. 

MR. AXILROD.  No, you don™t, but I™d be glad to have them forwarded to you. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, yes, I certainly want to see them.  I was under the impression that you do that on
ce a year and then you stop. MR. AXILROD.  No, we get a printout monthly. 

MR. PARTEE.  Well, I think we ought to ha
ve a summary table in the Greenbook now that 
we™re doing them monthly.  I think th
at™s a fairly recent development. 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, we could-
-I think a summary table. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me start with them. 

MR. AXILROD.  I™ve been getting them mont
hly for some time.  You know the exact-- 
MR. PARTEE.  ™75. 
MR. AXILROD.  The manufacture of them-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  [Unintelligible] our 
excellent staff has a way of hoarding 
treasures. 
MR. PARTEE.  If I may, Mr. Chairman, that
 very point bears on President Morris™s question, because my thought was that there could be
 more inventory accumulation than is in the 
projection.  There could be more 
plant and equipment, and there could be more inflation.  All 
that would add to the nominal GNP, and it would 
also add to the corporate, business financing need of the year as it went on, so that the consistency of the flow of funds with the current GNP 
projection has to be looked at both ways.  But also can be stronger. 
3/15/77 - 16 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  An evaluation of the flow 
of funds doesn™t find the normal kind of 
pressure points in credit markets that you often a
ssociate with it.  That™s one of the problems. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And these flow of funds projections have been revised, but about the same time when the GNP, etcetera, projections were revised? 
MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  I might add that we will be glad to work on a summary table and 
use them.  I™m not sure--we won™t have it in 
time for the Greenbook because of our schedule; we 
will either have to have it appended to the Bl
uebook or [provide] it separately on Monday, but 
we can forward it. 
MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that
 the analysis of velocity numbers for the 
third year of expansion would suggest extremely h
eavy pressures in the credit markets.  Because 
the flow of funds numbers are giving us a contrary
 indication, it would be quite unique to have a third-year expansion with very little change in corporate demand and the big jump in velocity 
coming together. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You can say, using National Bureau [of Economic Research] 
chronology, that we will soon be entering the third year of a business cycle expansion.  But you can also say that a new expansi
on started in the month of October.  Now, I think business cycle 
analysis has to be flexible, and while the Natio
nal Bureau scheme has great virtue--I couldn™t say 
anything else--in our own thinking about developments
 in the economy, we have to use that 
along with other judgments or othe
r ways of looking at the economy. 
MR. MORRIS.  I think also the fact that the recession was much more severe than most in 
the past is another dimension. 
MR. AXILROD.  I would add, Mr. Chairman, that
 we do have an indicator in the second half of 1977 that is often associated with credit market pressure
s, and by that time we do expect 
the banking system to be financing more of busine
ss than it did last year.  That is, the trend, the last two months of ™76 and early 
™77 of increased business loan demand, we expect [it] to remain 
fairly substantial throughout the year, with mortgage needs, consumer needs.   
We would expect the banking system would not be as substantial a financer of the government--as we get into the latter
 part of this year--as it had been, and we would project that the household sector would have to buy a very substantial amount of government securities by 
the second half of this year.  And more, for exam
ple, than they were buying on average in ™74; considerably more than in ™75 and ™76.   
So from that aspect, in the last
 half of this coming year, we 
do get a traditional source of upward rate pressures, that is, the necessity to price Treasuries so you could sell them to the 
household [sector] favorably priced relative to [Regulation] Q ceilings, things like that. MR. WALLICH.  If I may follow up on Frank Mo
rris™s point, I think these two things--the projected rise in velocity, which is really re
markable, and the contrary
 indication of business plant financing needs--do belong together.  But ma
ybe they belong together in a different way.  Namely, that at a time when there is no great pr
essure for business financing, there is then the possibility of getting much more work and tur
nover out of the given money supply because the 
3/15/77 - 17 - 
    money supply isn™t being increased by business financing.  So that
 we might get high rates of 
increase of velocity without the kind of interest rate pressure that™s-- 
MR. MORRIS.  Offsetting balances?   

MR. WALLICH.  At least this is a hypothesis.
  I am troubled and puz
zled by this very high increase in velocity, including a high increase in V2, which supposedly does not move around 
that much. 
MR. AXILROD.  I think, Governor Wallich, [what]
 is being left out is that we are--we 
may be wrong, we have been wrong for two strai
ght years--but we are projecting a rather substantial rise in interest rates.  Now, it may tu
rn out to be higher, but we are projecting a rise from about 4-1/2 percent for th
e bill rate to 7 percent.  That gets you up into the area of disintermediation, and that
 disintermediation is what causes the 
income velocity of M2 to rise.  
So in some sense we have a rather consistent 
set of projections, not inconsistent with past 
historical experience, once you feed-in the rise in interest rates and make allowance for some 
continuing shifts in financial technology.  It may be
 more intense, or it may be that we are wrong 
again and it will be less intense; we really don™t 
know.  But I think this is a fairly good sort of 
mean projection of the future. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All ri
ght.  Mr. Guffey, please. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Yes, question, Mr. Chairman, to
 Jerry.  As to the assumptions that the staff is building into your projections both on price and GNP with respect to the drought in the 
western part of the United States, and if that moderates for the bette
r or gets substantially worse, will it make a substantial difference in your projections? 
MR. ZEISEL.  Yes, we have built in an increase in the second half
 of ™77 and early ™78, which reflects the news that™s come in--unfort
unate nature of the weather in the West and 
Midwest.  I think we are still on the relatively op
timistic side of the range of forecasts.  It™s 
conceivable that if the news con
tinues bad, if the weather really is as bad as
 it appears to be at this point, and that continues to be the case, we could easily get another 1 to 1-1/2 percentage point rise in food prices in late ™77 and early ™78. MR. GUFFEY.  Would it materia
lly affect your GNP forecast?  Is food that big of a 
component? 
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, it certainly will affect the GNP
 forecast in the sense that this will be a 
tax on consumers for higher prices for food, and this
 has a negative effect in general--aside from 
the distinct possibility that it may erode c
onsumer attitudes about the outlook for the economy 
and may be evident in a much more signi
ficant way in purchases of other things. MR. GUFFEY.  With respect to you
r latter point, I think that is 
a very real consideration in our part of the world, in the sense that there is real pessimism yet with respect to the economy in 
the western--Tenth District, at least. 
MR. PARTEE.  Mr. Chairman, is that [pessimi
sm] there because of low farm prices?  Or 
high farm prices?   
3/15/77 - 18 - 
    MR. GUFFEY.  It™s a combination of high fa
rm cost and low prices for the product.  
Coupled with the fact that they have been through a very difficult winter, and the outlook isn™t very bright even yet.  I should quickly add that a good rain or two would change that very quickly, and particularly when the sap begins to
 rise in the spring, those attitudes can change.  
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Did you get a rainstorm the other day? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Roos. 
MR. ROOS.  In connection with this, just last week the head of one of our very large industries with significant activity 
in the western part of the nation said that, as important as the 
continued drought in that part of the country might 
be as an effect on food prices, they feel that there™s a terribly serious possibility of a drought affecting the generation of electrical energy, with the very real possibility of plants having to actually curtail operations due to an inadequate supply of energy as a result of the low water in the dams.  Now this is just an aside, but he was 
very strong in this. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Roos.  Mr. Mayo, please. MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I have never felt an
y confidence in the velocity projections.  I asked my staff, though, to go back and chart th
e actuals of annual rates of change from one 
quarter to the same quarter a year later to see 
what it looked like, and I find the projections a little more comfortable with that background in
 mind.  Not only have there been, oh, I think it 
comes to about 26 quarters out of the last 30 ye
ars that we have had more than a 5 percent 
velocity change; but more important than that, I no
te in charting this that there is definitely a 
primary and secondary peak in every business cy
cle all the way along the line, with the possible exception of ™70-™73, where it isn™t as apparent.  The secondary peak typically is not quite as high as the primary peak, but there 
is a definite recurrence of an expansion in velocity later in the 
cycle. 
MR. PARTEE.  As interest rates go up. 
MR. MAYO.  Yes.  This is M1, though. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I haven™t said a word about velocity.  But I believe members 
of the Committee know my basic thi
nking.  Interest rates play a role.  But the predominant factor in changes in velocity is not the rate of interest but the state of 
confidence.  And if those of us who believe that confidence is improving turn ou
t to be right, it™s a pretty good prospect that velocity will rise, will be at a quite high level.  Mr. Partee. MR. PARTEE.  Well, I also have a comment about
 velocity.  I™m glad that Bob came back 
to it, because it doesn™t seem so 
far out of line--I think a lot of co
mments about velocity that I am 
hearing relate to M1 velocity, and they don™t take into account what we believe to be the substitution process.  That ha
s been accelerating and 
may be reaching a level of a stampede.  
And so I think that we are in some danger here
 of reasoning on the basis of past relationships, even making some allowance for them, that still don™
t hold.  It™s still not relevant because of the rapid change in the meaning of 
narrow money supply to GNP.   
3/15/77 - 19 - 
    Now I have to admit that I can™t remember 
much about M2 velocity; perhaps we ought to 
have more historical information on that, but I ju
st can™t keep it in mind.  But I do think that I 
recall the times when M2 and M3 ran up less
 rapidly because of what Steve said of disintermediation--rising market interest rates re
lative to institutional rates--and in which there 
must have been increases in M2 and M3 velocity.  Paul has got the charts; [do they] show it? MR. AXILROD.  Governor Partee, the increase in 
velocity that we have is high relative to past experience.  In the third year of the 1970 expansion, M2 velocity rose at about a 2 percent annual rate, and in the third year of the ™54 expansion at about a 3 percent annual rate, and what we have is about a 3 percent annual rate of rise. MR. PARTEE.  The M2 on President Volcker™s chart projection looks a little stronger on the rise in velocity, and M3 doesn™t look out of line. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Velocity
 of M3--velocity is declining. MR. PARTEE.  Yes, and it seems to me quite possi
ble.  I might also sa
y that I also have a great difficulty with M2 velocity when you rememb
er what™s in M2, that is, when you remember 
what commercial bank time deposits have been adde
d in order to make M2.  It includes state and 
local government deposits, it includes large CD
s and nonnegotiable large CDs everywhere; it includes negotiable CDs in the nonweekly re
porting banks; and now it includes consumer 
certificates having maturities of f
our to six years, [which] don™t seem to me to have an awful lot 
of moneyness about them.  So I am
 always nervous about this more
 than M2 velocity, and also because of those definitional problems. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other commen
t on the overall economic situation and 
prospects?  I think it would be helpful to have
 a show of hands on the 
part of members of the 
Committee on your judgments about the economic pros
pect.  If you feel that our staff projection is more or less in the ballpark, as far as the 
real economy is concerned, will the members of the 
Committee be good enough to raise their hands? 
MR. BROIDA.  Eleven. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much.  I 
asked for that show of hands for a very definite reason.  We now have a monthly detail
ed report of Committee deliberations, which is 
made public.  And our staff has to [write it] on the 
basis of what is said at this table, and not enough has been said about the general economic 
outlook.  And to aid our staff on that very critical point, I asked for a show of hands. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I did not ra
ise my hand on that because I think the 
pattern is going to be different. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you™ve made that
 comment before, and I supported you, but I was thinking really of the-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  Thinking of the-- 
3/15/77 - 20 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --pattern, not the average 
for the year rather th
an the pattern.  All 
right now, would anyone else like to speak?  If not, this is as
 good a time as any to break for 
coffee. [Coffee break] MR. STERNLIGHT.  [State
ment--see Appendix].   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  
Mr. Black?  Please. 
MR. BLACK.  Peter, has market sophisticati
on reached the point--now that they [have] 
deemphasized the recent figures on money supply a
nd [have] moved on to monthly figures--that 
they also, similarly, [have] deemphasized a
ny bulge in the April money supply, remembering 
that this happened last April and was then reve
rsed the next couple of months?  Will they take 
this in stride, or are they going to be terribly surprised? MR. STERNLIGHT.  I don™t know that they re
ally have.  Some of the recent week-to-
week reactions have been a little milder, but there 
is still a good deal of sensitivity to the weekly 
numbers and interest in seeing how the Desk migh
t respond.  There is, of course, a consciousness that the growth was slower in Febr
uary, so that if there were to be a pickup [in growth rates] in March and April, the market would perhaps not jump to a conclusion.  Unless they got some sign 
from the Fed, they would not come to a conclu
sion that this was going to be followed by some 
stiffer posture at the Desk. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  On that point, Mr. Chairman--I was going to mention 
this later--but I report the impressi
on of my staff, rather than an 
impression I get directly, that the 
market has looked into this bulge problem, [and] th
eir estimates of the bulge from the rebates is 
substantially larger than our own, meaning the New York Bank™s.  I 
suspect also the Board™s.  If 
that is true, perhaps it raises some interesti
ng psychological problems of that time--if they think 
our estimate of the bulge is the same as their 
estimates of the bulge [but] their estimate is 
substantially larger. 
MR. BLACK.  Paul, to compound the confusion, 
our estimate is larger than yours, too. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I mean much larger. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think our staff 
estimate will satisfy everyone because it 
will not present a single point estimate, it will pres
ent several estimates.  I was just talking to Mr. 
Axilrod, and I think he had in mind presenting three 
sets of estimates; each set of estimates will 
cover several months, and I suggested that he 
might not stop at three [but] go beyond that.  So 
that the range of uncertainty will be fully reflect
ed and all that will be before the Board in due 
course. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?  Peter, has there been any 
reaction in the market to the change 
in our policy on purchases of agencies? MR. STERNLIGHT.  Very little, as I commente
d.  Very few people in the market raised 
the question about it, and it was done in rather a low-key way, and we™ve been unable to detect 3/15/77 - 21 - 
    any change in the quotations for the eligible versus ineligible issues, either as to the level of prices and yields or the spreads on those quotations. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, that is very good, as I understand.  It really means that 
we™ve been so wise in not becoming the dominant 
factor of market increase.  If we had been, 
you™d see some market reaction. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, I think activity ha
d been pretty light in those issues. MR. COLDWELL.  Are the dealers showi
ng you any agency issues for purchase? MR. STERNLIGHT.  We haven™t had occasion 
in the last few months to go in and buy 
agency issues when we do get quite a sizable range of offerings.   MR. COLDWELL.  What you™re saying, then, is 
that only when you go out and ask for the agency offerings do you get some offerings. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Right.  There™ve been to
o few occasions when we have anything to 
do, away from our go-rounds.  Those with Treasury coupon issues will occasionally have some 

foreign-customer orders, so that it™s worth the 
dealer™s while to show us occasional Treasury 
coupon offers, but it would be rare with an agency. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I hear no other question or comment.  Now the time has come for 
a motion to confirm transactions of 
the Desk.  Is there such a motion? 
SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been ma
de and seconded.  I hear no dissent. MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
MR. LILLY.  May I ask a technical question? 
 Wouldn™t that show up if this was being financed in the funds market?  Wouldn™
t that show up in other liabilities? MR. AXILROD.  Yes. 

MR. LILLY.  Well, then, have 
you had a verification of it? MR. AXILROD.  Well, we get reports on, the da
ily report of deposits of federal funds and other borrowings.  RPs--there are varying definitions, District by District, so it™s not exactly 
comparable.  And what I was reporting on--our a
ggregation of that for all member banks, with 
some added allowance for the nonmember banks--a
nd this figure, for example, such borrowing net of lending [unintelligible] showed an increase, on this fragmentary basis, of $3.6 billion in 
February, whereas in February 
of the three previous years, it had declined, on average, $400 million.  So that™s the factual basis for it, but, I 
would hasten to add, it is fragmentary, and I was 
offering an explanation which should be taken in the nature of a hypothesis. MR. PARTEE.  We can™t 
distinguish between the federal funds and RPs. 3/15/77 - 22 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  No, we don™t, but I don™t think that Governor Partee-- MR. PARTEE.  Federal funds in concept would be borrowed from another bank and thus 
would not change total bank credit. MR. AXILROD.  No, no.  I was giving you net.  I was netting out, and this would be the loans to the nonbanks.  This would be from a
ll nonbanks.  An S&L, for example would be a 
lender here.  A corporation would be a lender under an RP.  An S&L could be under federal 
funds. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, any 
other questions?  Mr. Wallich, please. 
MR. WALLICH.  Can one try to anticipate the 
behavior of businesses as they look toward the rebates and the bulge?  Is it reasonable to thin
k that it will be different from the behavior of 
banks, in that the businesses must anticipate a spurt in sales, therefore an increase in liquidity?  

This ought to cause them to be less liquid in advance, knowing that these funds are likely to come to them. 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, if they were going to do 
anything in anticipation of sales, I would 
assume they would build up inventory somewhat 
and possibly borrow from banks in order to do so, which would be, in a sense, reducing their liquidity somewhat.  I have no evidence of an 
unusually substantial inventory buildup in anticipation of such sales.  But maybe Mr. Zeisel-- 
MR. ZEISEL.  There was, as I mentioned earlie
r, actually a rundown of inventories late in 
the year.  The only thing we have for January to date is manufacturing and wholesale trade 
inventories.  There was some ri
se in materials, particularly, 
and raw materials, and goods in 
process.  It™s felt that a significant amount of that
 was a backup because of the inability fully to 
ship during the cold weather.  So we don™t really see any intended buildup in inventories very clearly as yet. 
MR. WALLICH.  I wouldn™t disagree with your 
analysis that it might call for an increase 
in inventory.  But the more immediate look ahead
 suggests simply that more cash is going to come in, and they may meet that from existing i
nventory as well as from a previous buildup.  So that the main impact of looking 
ahead to the bulge would seem to me would be in the demand for 
M1 and other liquid assets. MR. PARTEE.  --would fall just prior to the refund.  I don™t think we saw anything like that in 1975. MR. COLDWELL.  You may have 
said this, but it didn™t sink in.  You said the second quarter does not contemplate the effect
 of the rebate.  Is that correct? MR. AXILROD.  No, what I said was that we 
expect a substantial effect in the second 
quarter but that the March-April figures currently before the Co
mmittee do not include any effect 
of the rebates directly because we don™t expect the payments to begin until May.   MR. COLDWELL.  And yet, you do expect a si
gnificant effect in the full second quarter? 3/15/77 - 23 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  Yes, at the moment, on the order of 2 percentage points on average, but 
that™s quarter-over-quarter, roughly.  I would expect substantial effects in May and June--very large, in fact. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I guess my timing is a lit
tle bit different.  I thought you might get 
those mailed out in late May, a
nd you might start getting an imp
act in mid-June, which would 
mean that your deferred impact would be into the third quarter. 
MR. AXILROD.  On that mailing period you woul
d get less effect in
 the second quarter, assuming our rough assumption at the moment, [which] is that the first mailing will be around 

the end of the first week in May.  Now, again, that will depend on when the legislation is passed, 

whether the Treasury can gear up to mailing out th
e checks, which we will know more definitely, 
of course, in the next four weeks. MR. COLDWELL.  I™m looking at your pattern 
here, on whatever table this is on p. 5 of the Bluebook, showing the M1 pattern for the altern
ative B.  In effect, you™ve got stability for 
three quarters and a 3-1/2 percent jump in one quarter. MR. AXILROD.  Yes, that quarter, the second quarter, does include about roughly plus 2 for the rebates, and the third quarter roughly a minus 2. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Coming back to the disc
ussion concerning inventory, I thought we 
had a prospect of relatively slow inventory growth in the first and second quarters, which does not seem to me to imply major expansi
on for inventory purposes in bank credit. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Slow growth in inventories in the second quarter? MR. COLDWELL.  First, and second. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, I understand the first, not the second. MR. COLDWELL.  Well, at leas
t in the early part of the second.  Maybe that™s my 
problem.  I™m looking really through mid-May. 
MR. ZEISEL.  Our assumption has been that there would be a moderate rate of growth in 
inventory investment--actually, a ra
te of inventory investment th
at™s quite modest during this 
period.  If I may refer to the discussions I™ve had 
with business people, particularly at the retail trade level, I have asked them a
bout their anticipations in regard to the impact of the rebates.  And they tend to be rather cautious.  One of them said, for exam
ple, that he was afraid that the 
individual stores will start over-responding. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You™re reporting the thinking of an economist. 
MR. ZEISEL.  I am reporting the thinking of an
 economist at one of the chains.  I suppose 
I should distinguish between businessmen and ec
onomists--you™re right, Mr. Chairman.  But the 
company policy in this particular chain and in 
the case of several others was to be rather 
conservative in building inventories during this period. 3/15/77 - 24 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  Of course, you could have offsets,
 too.  That is, the retailers could build it up, and it could come out of the manu
facturers in the first instance. MR. COLDWELL.  Yes.  A different stage of
 inventory operations here, but who™s doing the financing through bank credit, I guess is the question.  If you™re building your M1 growth exclusively on the rebate, that would be one thing, but I gather you are not. MR. AXILROD.  Lord no. 
MR. COLDWELL.  On the stre
ngth of the economy, bank credit demands, and so forth; 
partly on the inventory expansion. MR. AXILROD.  Right, right.  Now, we would expect a rather substantial second quarter based on the strength of the economy, which, of cour
se, in itself also reflects partly the rebates.  But, in addition, it™s the particular effect on the rebates and people just holding cash for, on average, a little bit longer than they normally hold it. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions or comments?  If not, we are ready for the 
discussion on monetary policy.  Gentlemen, I am 
inclined to think that we don™t have a very difficult job today.  Having said that, I will say no
 more, for a while anyway.  Who would like to 
speak first, at somewhat great
er length but not excessively? VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don™t know whether it™s difficult or not, but I want to be radical and suggest that we be particularly
 sensitive to our long-range intentions on the 
aggregates today, and that should make it easy.  
I say that against the feeling that the business outlook is quite satisfactory, but the risks may be
 greater of maybe getting a little too much too 
soon and aggravating this price and interest rate sensitivity.  I continue to feel, or hope, anyway, that the kind of macroanalysis on prices that th
e economists have presented is valid, but there are 
a whole lot of psychological and confidence problems at work here
, and they are important, and 
they are important in th
e financial markets, too.  [Those probl
ems include] the fear of deficits 
and, I think, some underlying concern that maybe 
the Federal Reserve may turn out to be too 
easy in the end, when the crunch comes, in terms 
of a different trend in interest rates.   Maybe in some of this thinking of uncertain
ty about the price situation and about the interest rate situation, a feeli
ng that between the deficits and maybe some pressure toward too 
expansionary a monetary policy, [it] would be 
counterproductive in terms of interest rates [ending] up higher rather than lower if we don™t handle it right.  And this rebate problem is going 
to confuse things in the spring and may make it 
difficult during that period to repair any move 
that we make now or [any] failure to make a move now.   
Having said all that, I don™t see any case for making any aggressive move at all in the 
money market indicators right at th
e moment.  But what I™d like to 
see is a situation set up so that 
if the aggregates do begin moving on the high side
--and, indeed, I™d accept the symmetrical side of that, if they continue low--w
e be prepared to move reasonably
 quickly in a modest way.  And 
I guess I don™t like the matrix 
that™s set up for us, which depends very much on a specific projection of the money aggregates for the two-
month period.  And a typical way of doing this--
it puts a lot of weight on whether there is a deviation from the cu
rrent projection--the short-term 
projection--rather than how we are doing in terms of the longer-run projections.   3/15/77 - 25 - 
    If I look at it in terms of the longer- r
un projections, you come out more like the C 
alternative in the Bluebook.  Even there, M1 is too high.  It doesn™t straddle, symmetrically 
anyway, the longer-term target, and 
I would like to see it straddle that target a little more.  The 
M2 projection does straddle it very symmetrically--a half a point on either side--and I™m sure it 
would make me happier if the M1
 short-term range was reduced to
 something like 4 to 8 percent, 
maybe even 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, which woul
d be symmetrical around the longer-term range.  I 
would do that without contemplating 
any particular change in the federal funds rate at this point.   But then, if we began moving in the upper part of those ranges, we would begin moving 
the federal funds rate a bit.  Just where I™d put the limits on the 
federal funds rate--I don™t feel strongly about the particular numbers.  I might be
 inclined to a 4-1/4 percent to 5-1/4 percent range [with] 4-3/4 as a midpoint or
 4-5/8 to 4-3/4, a slightly asymmetrical midpoint.  I would be 
equally happy--maybe slightly happier--with a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent range but leave the 

midpoint, in effect, asymmetrical--leave it 
where it is, or maybe 4-3/4 percent.   
But what I am looking for here is not a move 
at the moment in terms of the money market 
but a readiness to move quite ge
ntly if the aggregates began co
ming in toward the upper end or 
beyond the upper end of our longer-term ranges.  B
ecause if we didn™t make that move if that 
happened, we might be piling up a l
ittle difficulty in the future, when we certainly expect the 
aggregates to be rising more rapidly for some months thereafte
r, during a period when obviously 
we™ll make our own estimates of 
what the rebate influence was.  But it might be difficult to act 
very much even if it exceeded our estimate of what
 the rebate affect was, as current estimates do 
assume.   
So basically I would specifical
ly substitute for that M1 range under C something more like 
the long-term range.  I™d be satisfied with a fed funds range more like what we have, or just 
slightly tipped up on the upper side without any change in the actual rate, at the moment, until 
we saw the evidence in the aggregates. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  I would pretty much endorse what Mr. 
Volcker has stated.  And it might possibly focus ou
r discussion a little better if I suggested some 
numerical specifications for the Committee 
to shoot at one way or another.   
I would suggest that we adopt a range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1, 7 to 11 for M2, and stay where we are for the federal funds rate range and also [for] the slightly fuzzy midpoint between 
4-5/8 and 4-3/4.  Mr. Coldwell, may we hear from you next. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to start talking before Mr. Volcker.  
He stole what I wanted to say.  I had a slightly different perspective, but it tracks what he had in mind.  I really had in mind bringing that M1 down 
to the 4 range and lifting the top of the M1 to 
9, but giving some movement in there, as Mr. Vo
lcker has indicated, as we approach either the 
top or the bottom--and I assume 
it™s going to be the top--that we start moving slightly.   
On the federal funds range, I had planned to
 suggest to the Committee a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, 
with the same fuzzy 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 percent center point until we see some movement.  I am 
bothered also, as he indicated, about this basing it on a projection.  I have a nagging suspicion that these things are not going to work out with all of this beautiful symmetry that the staff has 
3/15/77 - 26 - 
    worked out for us, and I suspect we might be surp
rised on either too high or too low a level.  And consequently I would hope that we would have a 
little more upward side to this, but, in effect, 
validate these projections before we make a move. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell.  Mr. Black, please. MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I have a feeling 
that in the second quarter we are going to see a pretty substantial bulge in
 the aggregates.  We™ve touched on many of these points, and our 
own work suggests we™ll have even a greater rise in April associated with the buildup in balances by individuals around the April tax dates.  Then, with the rebates and, later on, special Social Security payments, we think it™s going to be
 a pretty good bulge throughout all of the second quarter.   Now I think we have to be rather cautious in reacting to such tax-related bulges in 
aggregates, since as the staff points out these are likely to be reversed later on.  The problem 
here, to me, is to distinguish between the part th
at results from these special factors and the part 
stemming from an underlying increase in demand 
for money.  I don™t know any way to do this, 
so I think we ought to remain particularly alert 
to increases in the volume of commercial paper 
and business loans at banks.  My own feeling is that we are going to get a larger demand on the 
part of the public for money than was true in 
1975 and 1976, when we had similar bulges.  But of 
course you can™t tell at this point.  Overall, I think the aggregates are behaving better now than I can remember their behaving at any time si
nce I have been sitting around the table.   Since these are uncertainties for the present, I™d
 be inclined to hold pretty much to our 
current stance.  So, along with alternative B as 
a general prescription for the March-April period-
-but since I think, for tax-related reasons, M1 growth in April could be much stronger than the Bluebook suggests--I would be inclined to raise that M1 range to 6 to 10 percent and leave the M2 at 7 to 11.  And I agree with the assessment of all of you th
at we ought to have this fuzzy midpoint of the range, 
4-5/8 to 4-3/4.   At this stage, since I think what strength we
 see in the aggregates may be largely a tax-
related phenomenon, I would be relu
ctant to see the funds rate m
oving more than 5 to 10 basis points above that 4-3/4 in any week, even if the aggregates are coming in 
a little bit above these 
limits that we™ve set.  But I agree with Paul™s long
-run assessment of the probl
em.  It™s just that I 
think you are going to have some rather misleading 
signals in this period.  We™ve been fooled a 
couple of times in recent years and it could happen again. 
MR. PARTEE.  That was 6 to 10 for March and April--those two months.  You want a 6 to 
10 range for March-April--before the refund is paid out? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Eastburn, please. MR. EASTBURN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
I™ve been impressed with the earlier discussion of the degree of uncertainty that I think exists for the ne
xt few months.  I think if we had perfect knowledge, we™d try to anticipate some things--we™d try to anticipate the price 
increases which a number of us feel are likely
 but we™re not sure about, and we™d do some 
anticipation of the rebate and its effect.  Probably do some antic
ipation of the interest rate 
increase, so that it doesn
™t come too sharply.   
3/15/77 - 27 - 
    But in view of the uncertainty about all three of
 these, I think it is the best thing to do to 
stay approximately where we are.  I don™t thi
nk we should be permitting interest rates to go up 
substantially until the money supply seems to be behaving quite differently than it is.  So I 

generally like very much, Mr. Chairman, your sp
ecifications for the aggregates.  And I also would hold to the specification for the funds rate.   I would like to suggest, however, one possible modification on the funds
 rate.  I think we 
have the makings, [in] this fuzzy range of 4-5/8 to 4-7/8, of the possibility of getting more 

movement in the funds rate from week to week
 than we have been getting.  And one possible way to do this is to widen that inside spread very slightly and make that something like 4-5/8 to 
4-3/4.  With Paul, I think I agre
e that this already happened. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Your first number you meant 4-5/8 
to 4-3/4, and the second you meant 4-5/8 to 4-7/8? 
MR. EASTBURN.  I think one thing this might do, with Paul™s
 suggestion, would be to put us in a position of being prepared to introduce greater flexibility on the upside if that appears necessary. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Kimbrel now, please. MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, I thought I™d 
acknowledge the [unintelligible] weather conditions induced and the uncertainties, but I guess I am quickly moved to the feeling that 
Governor Partee discussed somewh
at earlier.  I think the economy
 actually is going to be much 
stronger in the third and fourth quarters than we have [assumed].  Inventory-induced stronger real growth [and] capital investments--I think that™s
 going to react in prices, create difficulties in 
financial markets, relate to inte
rest rates.  And I™d hope that maybe even now we™d begin to not 
offset or necessarily anticipate but to be aware of and guard against some of that and against 
excessive growth in the aggregates.   With that I would be quite happy with the num
bers you have assigned to the aggregates.  In the federal funds area, I™m perfectly agreeable 
still with the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 numbers.  But more 
than I™ve heard expressed otherwise, I™d want to lean a little b
it more in the area of 4-3/4 to 
4-7/8.  And if we are indeed going to be moving in 
the area of 7 percent by the end of the year or early next year, I think that we might as well begin to gradua
lly do that without a precipitous move. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimbrel.
  Mr. Mayo, we will hear from you. 
MR. MAYO.  Well, again, my remarks were ma
de by Paul Volcker, to whom I give my 
thanks.  I have the same reasoning that he has,
 apparently.  Maybe it™s because I™m holding in 
my hand the Federal Reserve Bank of New York pencil, which I apparently stole when I was there two weeks ago, and it must have some effect.   
But, anyway, in the precision, I™m slightly di
fferent, I guess.  I wouldn™t care to move 
below 4 to 8 for M1.  I think I would want to
 move down from the 5 to 9 because I™m also 
concerned about getting closer, not precisely, but getting closer to a bracketing of our long-term 
range.  Particularly since the last two meetings, we™ve skidded al
ong fairly close to the very low 3/15/77 - 28 - 
    end of that range.  And I don™t want to give the appearance here of as significant a change in our short-term target as going 3 to
 7, 5 to 9 would indicate.   This may be imagery, but I think it is still of 
some significance.  I would prefer a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, Mr. Chairman, for the range, just raising th
e upper end of the fed funds range a little.  But I don™t think I would tamper with th
e 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 as the inner range at this point.  That is all. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Guffey. MR. GUFFEY.  Mr. Mayo has said what I would like to say, in the sense that the range 
that has been stated [for M1], 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, is satisfactory and probably more consistent with our staff projections of what may happen in the 
remainder of March on into April.  But more 
importantly, with respect to the federal funds rate
, we would opt for 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, increasing the upper side of that [a] quarter, making the midpoint 
4-3/4, with the hope that we would stay in the fuzzy range through most of the period and, again at
 this time next month, that we would end up 
at 4-3/4.  And essentially taking a very little bite [out] of what perhaps we may have to do in the 
May and June area, perhaps into July and the period ahead. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. Baughman now, please. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I am in ag
reement with what you have suggested.  I 
have to admit I had jotted down 4 to 8 for a ra
nge on M1, as compared 
to 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, but obviously that™s a very small difference.  I see no
 need to change the range on the federal funds at this time.  I am sympathetic, however, to
 Mr. Eastburn™s suggestion that it might be 
appropriate to widen the inside of the range somewhat.  Generall
y speaking, it seems to me it™s a 
period for standing pat.  With respect to the form 
of the directive, I™d be inclined to favor the aggregates directive rather than money market conditions. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Mr. Partee next, please. MR. PARTEE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I™m in a 
quandary, really, which I guess results in my 
being agreeable to your suggestion.  I do think strongly that our problem in the months to come 
is going to be overly large monetary aggregates
 growth and that we™re going to have deal increasingly with rising interest rates 
as a prevalent thing to cope with.   But on the other hand, up to now, we would have to say the aggregates have fallen short, or at least that they™ve been on the 
low side.  In particular, in January and February, for example, 
M1 was 3.1 percent, Paul ,well below the lower end of the long-run range.  And on M2, although I never thought that we were going to any pl
ace close to the bottom, it™s only 7.9 for the two 
months, which is getting down in the lower half 
of the range.  And, of course, February was 
more pronounced in both of those, in terms of a 
shortfall, than the January-February average.  And so it just seems to me we don™t have the fi
nancial indicators that would permit us in good 
conscience to take a step toward somewhat tighter conditions at this moment.   
Likewise, I™m nervous about M1.  Not understanding why February was so low, but just being given an explanation by Steve Axilrod, it occurs to me that 
there may have been some kind 
of a temporary inducement to go into RPs or federa
l funds, in lieu of cash balances, that might be 
reversed in this period immediately to come.  So that, as [has] happened to us so often, a low 
3/15/77 - 29 - 
    month could be followed by a high month.  There™s a considerably erratic 
growth record in M1, and I think we may stand a risk of
 getting a rather high growth ra
te.  I don™t think I could accept going as high as Bob Black suggests for thes
e two months--6 to 10 on M1--but I could accept 
either 5 to 9, which is the alternative B specification, or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2.   I think the most important point
 is that we should not go above the 5 percent funds rate without having a conscious redetermin
ation that that™s what we want
 to do.  But I think the most 
important thing is to leave that 
funds rate range at 4-1/4 to 5, with the same fu
zzy midpoint that 
we™ve had before.  So I could accept either 5 to 9 or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; M2 looks okay.  But the most important thing is to
 leave the funds rate in that range until we have a solid demonstration that we ought to go above. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee.  Mr. Wallich now, please. 

MR. WALLICH.  Well, it seems to me that we
 have a decision more of strategy than of 
economics here.  The economics of the situation,
 for what my view on it is worth--we have shocks ahead.  They come mostly from the monetary side, but to some extent inventory 

accumulation also from the real side.  That c
ounsels, broadly speaking, sticking with interest 
rates and letting the aggregates run.   But that argument, it seems to me, is dominate
d by broader considerations.  In the medium 
run, we™re going to have the prospect of rising interest rates.  The earlier we face up to that, I think, the less that increase will have to be and the better off we are.  We™re quite well positioned 
to meet this.  The aggregates have been slow, and we™ve accumulated some reserves, as it were, 

there.  I think we ought to go on accumulating as 
long as we can until the bulge hits us.   And that leads me to suggest, first, pulling dow
n the aggregates a little from alternative B, 
as you proposed, Mr. Chairman--4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for 
M1; 7 to 11 looks all right for M2; funds rate, I would widen a little on the up side, 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, and I would, over the period, suggest drifting up to 4-3/4 if nothing unexpected happens.  And despite all this emphasi
s on the funds rate, I would stick with an aggregates di
rective, because in the days ah
ead I think it would be important 
to draw public attention, even with a lag, to the aggregates rather than to interest rates. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Jackson now, please. 

MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I just think 
that the underlying economic situation is 
stronger than the staff expects, and that the prospects for continued expansion are probably better than they estimate, although how materially is ha
rd to anticipate, as mu
ch as it™s hard to anticipate anything.  It™s my guess that we will 
see some increases in the public™s demands 
despite our generally liquid position.  For that reason, I™m inclined for strategy reasons to go 
ahead and remind the country that the central 
bank will be responsive to that need.   
And while we have remained relatively static, almost mechanical, fo
r the last couple of months, I think we ought to not lure the market 
or the country into thinking that we would continue to do so.  And therefore, for strategy reasons as much as 
any other, I would be prepared to use a 4 to 8 [for M1] and a 6 to 10 [for M2], an
d a federal funds rate of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, moving 
to the midpoint with deliberate speed even now
, anticipating that it would have a generally salutary effect, even though it might be very small.   
3/15/77 - 30 - 
    Unfortunately, I think the problem of our 
meeting today is that we™re arguing over 
millimeters out of our universe, a
nd it™s somewhat foolish on our pa
rt, but at the same time, the 
market has gotten so sensitive to millimeters, I 
guess even those little tiny steps do have some 
psychological impact, and I th
ink it™s worth taking them. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Winn is after you. 
MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, have
 we got too short of a horizon in our view today?  How 
do we face the blip in terms of the tax [reb
ate] on M1?  And coinciding with an underlying 
thrust,  we may not get the decline after we ge
t the blip because the economic situation may 
counter the normal sort of a dec
line in M1 that we™re thinking about?  On the other hand, to just 
be ignoring the blip--if it goes up, we lose the rate, and we have to lower them, and it™s a bad 
signal.  And so what I™m concerned about is [w
hether] we™re not shutting ourselves off in our thinking in terms of just the April dead
line here, in terms of our forecast.  
On the other hand, raising the question, I don™t have a very good answer as to what we ought to do on the longer horizon.  But I™m just thinki
ng in terms of the stra
tegic sort of a move 
as to where you go on this sort of a thing.  It seems to me we™ve got an awful short horizon here 
in terms of policy.   
Now, do we ignore the blip, and then we ma
ke the adjustment?  And if you do that, and 
you take the rate spread we™ve got, in the last half of the year, an awful big rate rise to accomplish in a very short period of time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, as far as the bump in the money supply is concerned, I think 
we will have to make our estimates.  They
 could be wrong, and we should accommodate the 
bump that we estimate.  Then if it turns out that
 the rate of growth greatly exceeds our estimate, 
we will have to recognize that and counter it, but
 if it™s within the range of our estimate, we 
ought to leave it alone.  And we can always make 
mistakes.  Now take our figure for M1 for the 
month of February, we started out wi
th an estimate of--how much, Steve? 
MR. AXILROD.  6-1/2. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, 
6-1/2--we™re down to 8/10 of 1 percent.  Well, we made 
a mistake in 1975.  I think we should be a little 
more careful this time than we were in 1975 and 
not take our staff projections quite as literally as we tended to at that time.  But apart from that, if 
the figures come in very much a
bove our estimate, we™ll have to d
eal with it and recognize it.  I don™t see what else we can do.   I do think that, in view of the uncertainties--and I think Mr. Eastburn expressed that very 
well--we ought to be very cautious about any anticipatory movement that we make.  And we™re 
capable of responding--and responding quite promptly--without anticipating these very short-run adjustments.   
Well, there™s one other point that I have not mentioned befo
re, but I think it™s something 
on the side of strategy that is of importance to my mind.  We™ve 
had a period of virtual stability in the federal funds rate for some three months. 
 We didn™t plan it that way.  And we were ready to move one way or another depending on how th
e aggregates came in.  But in view of the 
3/15/77 - 31 - 
    behavior of the aggregates, the Desk did not move at all appreci
ably.  Now I think this three-month experience has proved most in
structive, and it has helped me
 enormously in dealing with members of the Congress and others.  Now there™
s only one interest rate over which we have a high degree of influence, and that is the federal funds rate.  That rate for some three months has 
been virtually constant.  In the meantime, our other 
interest rates, short-term rates, market rates, 
and, more particularly, longer-term interest
 rates, have moved up, and moved up very 
appreciably.  Well, now, the Federal Reserve has 
not played any role, except in so far as the market may have expected us to continue m
oving down, as we were for a time, and we stopped 
doing so.  And the response of ma
rket rates has been greatest in the particular maturities where 
the Treasury has concentrated its borrowing, and that has spread out over the medium-term and 
long-term market.   
And the very fact that the one interest rate that we virtually control has stood still for three months, while other market interest rates have 
shown very considerable movement, has served a 
very important educational purpose in my deali
ng with members of Congress who think that we 
control interest rates.  The 
New York Times thinks that; many people th
ink that; but we don™t.   So this is a consideration in my own mind
--there ought to be a clear reason for moving, 
and if there isn™t, since what we™re talking about
 are minute changes, really, I™d be inclined to 
stay with pretty much where we are on the federa
l funds rate.  And we still have a range to move 
down or move up [in], depending on 
the behavior of the aggregates.  We™ll, I™ve talked too long.  
Mr. Balles, please. 
MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I think a good d
eal of public reaction and psychology in the market place will probably depend on your follow-on remarks and how we will handle this 

bulge in the Ms because of the reba
tes.  You had some very interes
ting things to say about that in 
recent testimony, about how we had learned some
 lessons and probably could improve on our 
performance.  And I think a great deal of r
eaction in markets will depend, perhaps, on how you 
are going to testify on this the next ti
me around, whether this will be May and-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The next time around will be next week.  And the Senate Budget Committee wants to go into these very questions, 
very closely.  And the testimony I think will 
deal with that--that is, the prepared statement, quite apar
t from the oral questioning, which is going to be intensive in this area.  And it may be a good thing. 
MR. BALLES.  I think that would clear the air quite a bit, and particularly if it came 
through that, for the year as a whole, unless we see some signifi
cantly different change in the business outlook than we do now, we would prob
ably end up within the ranges that we heretofore specified, the 12-month ranges.   
If that point got across loud and clear; and if the country pretty well understood that this bulge--if it occurs, say, in the magnitude that 
Steve™s talked about in the second quarter--would 
be offset in the third quarter, and [if it was understood that] for the year as a whole we didn™t expect to accelerate the rate of
 monetary growth, I think that
 would be a healthy dampening influence on inflationary expectations.  That, in my mind, is the key to how the market™s going to 
react to our moves.   3/15/77 - 32 - 
    In getting down to the immediate situation, I would be prepared to accept your 
specifications, with the further proviso that we 
might--if the acceleration 
begins in the Ms during 
the March-April period, as Steve thinks it will--begin to lean against 
it a little bit by moving up fairly quickly to that 4-3/4 upper end of this fuzzy midpoint range.  If we don™t move a little bit 
now, we™ll have to move much faster later on in
 a rather precipitous upward movement, and that 
has bothered a number of people around th
e table, and it would bother me, too. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  As far as public psychology is concerned, I just want to add one more observation.  There was a feeling, rather widespread within the Congress, at least, that we deliberately set out 
to frustrate the will of the Congress in connection 
with the tax rebates in 1975.  And I think that this
 is a question that I w
ill have to address very 
specifically before that committ
ee.  Mr. Morris now, please. MR. MORRIS.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I would acc
ept your specifications, and I also agree with you that our actions in the coming months ought 
to be in response to the facts as they come 
in and not in anticipation that th
e projections will be realized.  I 
think, in general, this Committee 
has functioned better when it moved on the basis 
of the facts coming in 
than when it moved on the basis of projections.  I think of 1968 and 
1972, two years where we got in trouble because we acted not on the basis of facts coming in but 
on the basis of projections which proved to be 
incorrect.  So I think as a ge
neral strategy matter, the course
 you recommended is one that I would accept. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Lilly now, please. MR. LILLY.  Well, I™m somewhat more bullish th
an the staff.  However, I agree with your ranges for M1 and M2.  I would like to repeat what I said last mont
h; if I can see the outer limits 
[for the federal funds rate] from 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, it™s 
just that it is easier to get that 5-1/4 in there now than it will be a month from now.
  I like the 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 midpoint. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Lilly.  And we haven™t heard from several 
members of our family.  Who would like to 
speak next?  Yes, Mr
. Van Nice, please. MR. VAN NICE.  I think I share Mr. Balles™ concern as to what our long-range targets are going to be.  I could comment more wisely on ou
r short-range targets if
 I knew what™s going to happen perhaps next month, when you review the l
ong-range target.  We had a shortfall in the 
aggregates in the first quarter of
 the year, particularly in M1, and if we™re going to make up that 
shortfall, perhaps the second quarter is the best 
time to do it.  We might be in a better position to 
make it up this time than later on in the year.   
And that would seem to argue, really, for a
lternative A.  Instead of worrying about the shortfall in the first quarter of the year--I don™t happen to be worried about that, and I think the Committee in its wisdom possibly may even lowe
r the long-range targets next month, when I 
probably won™t be here.  And so I guess I would go along with either alternative B or alternative C. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Van Nice.  And we™ll hear from Mr. Gardner next. 
3/15/77 - 33 - 
    MR. GARDNER.  Well, gentlemen, I™m pleased 
with many of the perceptions that have 
been expressed, and I particularly want to identify with Mr. Morris™s view that we do better 
when we don™t deal with our expectations but we deal with what our cu
rrent knowledge is.  And I have nothing, really, to add to the discussion, 
because I synthesize it into some accord on the 
4-1/2 to 8-1/2 range for M1, and 7 to 11 on M2.   I want to point out that M2 has been living a reasonably happy life for many months.  M2 
has grown consistently, I think, based on a pattern of rates and structure that will begin to change.  We™ve seen some falloff now in the competitive nature of savings, and I expect to see 

more of it.  While I™ve never understood M1, I think if we can exclude M1 from M2, I think I 
can understand the residue called M2.  We™re going to have probabl
y some slower growth in M2 
for a variety of reasons in the competitive world.   
On the other hand--well not on the other hand, but as we get down to a federal funds range, I™m perfectly happy with the inner range.  I think 
it™s desirable and wise.  And I see no harm in 
adding 1/4 to the upper limit of that range, 
because, I don™t know, Frank, whether it™s my 
expectations or absolute assurance that there is going to be a rise in the federal funds rate sometime this year.  And I see no harm in expanding that a little bit for the comfort that we may 

gain philosophically from, in a sense, believing we are preparing modestly for the future, and 
that preparation would probably be inadequate.  So I wouldn™t find anything wrong with keeping 
the inner range and adding 1/4, and many people have spoken to that possibility about our outer limits of the federal funds rate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner.  Mr. Roos, would you like to speak now? MR. ROOS.  Well, I have nothing 
of value to add other than to say that I™m fully agreeable 
with 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; 7 to 11 on M2; and perhaps the upper limit of the fed funds rate 
placed at 5-1/4. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Roos.  Well, then, I think that on the basis of the opinions that have been conveyed by members of
 the [Committee], I™m quite ready to make a 
recommendation to the Committee for a vote, whic
h I think will express the consensus pretty 
closely.  Such differences as exist among us ar
e very minor.  And very few members of the 
Committee have expressed a view on the language 
of the directive, but I would assume we are 
not going to depart at all appreciably from our decision last mont
h that the monetary aggregates 
directive should be retained.   And therefore, I suggest that we vote on the following:  monetary aggregates directive; an 
M1 rate of growth of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2; an M2 range of 7 to 11 percent; a federal funds range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent, but with a midpoint of 
4-5/8 to 4-3/4, where we happen to be at the present time.  Now if there is no dissent or no co
mment, and I hear none, I™ll ask the Secretary to 
call the roll. 
MR. BROIDA. 
Chairman Burns  Yes 

Vice Chairman Volcker  Yes 

Governor Coldwell  Yes 
3/15/77 - 34 - 
    Governor Gardner  Yes 
President Guffey  Yes 

Governor Jackson Yes 

Governor Lilly  Yes 

President Mayo  Yes 

President Morris  Yes 

Governor Partee  Yes 

President Roos  Yes 

Governor Wallich  Yes 
Unanimous. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Then we have
 a few matters of business that we need to 
take up, and let us turn to item 9 on the agenda, 
which deals with the authority of the Desk to 
lend securities from our account.  Mr. St
ernlight, would you good enough to comment on-- 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I™ll comment very briefly 
as indicated in the March 4 memorandum, 
Mr. Chairman.  The [System Open Market] Ac
count Manager continues to find the lending program reasonably necessary to the effective 
functioning of the governme
nt securities market 
and, hence, to our open market operations.  The 
dollar volume of lending was up in the past year 
but much less than in proportion to to
tal trading activity in the market.   
Without system lending in securities, we belie
ve the fail situation could have been much 
worse in the past year, and the market would not 
have functioned as well.  The System™s charge 
for lending, which exceeds the charge set by other lenders, far more than covers our costs.  For 
the [Federal Reserve Bank of] New York, earnings 
from lending securities la
st year were nearly $2 million.  Our expenses attributable to lending 
are estimated at something less than 10 percent 
of that figure.  That™s all I have. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any comment?  A
ny dissent from the recommendation? 
MR. PARTEE.  Is it true that you need to fi
nd this reasonably necessary to the functioning 
on the market account?  Can you do that in good 
conscience with the volume of governments 
that are outstanding now? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Given that we have a charge that™s double what other lenders are charging and that people are coming to us, we belie
ve that the fail situation would be materially 
worse if our lending program was not there.  
So I think we can reach that conclusion. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, any othe
r comment?  Any objection to permitting the 
Desk to function as it has been functioning in this area? 
 I hear none.   Let™s turn to item 11 on the agenda, the Au
thorization for [Domestic Open Market] 
Operations.  No changes are being proposed by the staff.  Do members of the Committee wish to 
propose any change?  Apparently not.   
Let us proceed then to item 12, and ther
e we need to review, once again, certain authorizations.  First, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations; next, the Foreign 3/15/77 - 35 - 
    Currency Directive; and next, the Procedural Instructions.  And I 
hope that is clear.  And finally, a special authorization which I hope
 is superlatively clear.   Now, the first question, do members of th
e Committee seek clar
ification of these categories to just what is involved?  I hear no such requests.  No
 changes proposed by the staff.  Do members of the Committee wish to propose a 
change or raise any questions?  The members 
of the Committee are singularly 
acquiescent on these matters, which must mean that we™re doing 
things just right.   And we have finally an item that I was hopi
ng we would never get to, but the hour permits 
it.  But if we can™t solve this problem in the next ten minutes, I 
suggest that we postpone further deliberations on it.  And that™s
 the report of the Subcommittee 
on Bankers™ Acceptances.  That 
report has been made available.  And Gove
rnor Gardner is prepared to advise us. MR. GARDNER.  Mr. Chairman, the [sub]co
mmittee--a well-balanced group--met and 
discussed the issues which are fully set forth in the memorandum.  I hope everyone has had a 
chance to read it.  If you have, you know it™s the [sub]committee™s conc
lusion that the Desk continue to use repurchase agreements in banker
s™ acceptances, which is a useful and important 
tool.   Point number two, that the Desk will allow it
s direct holdings of 
acceptances--which are 
now at about $175 million and have been much reduced
 from the peak in the past, when we were 
up near 3/4 billion dollars--to run off and no l
onger engage in direct purchases of bankers™ acceptances from the accepting bank.  If someone 
wishes to discuss the issues, they™re on pages 
4 and 5, the arguments for and against.   
I want to assure you there was a full and comp
lete discussion [within] the [sub]committee. 
There remain--we can go back to that in a moment
--but there remain two or
 three other items.  If 
the Committee does approve the recommendation befo
re it, there is a question about how we 
treat the present authorization to the Desk.  Th
e [sub]committee felt in the majority that they 
would leave the authorization in
 place for direct purchases up to $100 million--not practice or 
use that authority routinely, but have it available for exceptional 
developments.  One member of 
the [sub]committee, President Eastburn, felt we should remove entirely that authorization and 
retain only the language that pertains to the repurchase process, which is contemplated by the 
[sub]committee™s origin
al recommendation.   
The majority of the [sub]committee then is recommending that we continue to use 
repurchase agreements on bankers™ acceptances; that
 we allow our outright portfolio to run off, 
which it is presently in the process of doing; that we leave the authorization in place for 
emergencies or exceptional developments; and fina
lly, that there should be some form of public 
release, if the Desk is no longer the direct buyer of acceptances.   
Lastly, there was some discussion about the quality of acceptances.  The Desk has 
generally followed the practice of treating what the market considers prime to be prime and to 
deal only in prime acceptances.  Of course, by 
the workings of our own intimate knowledge of 
the banking system, we may often have some diff
erent perceptions about what is a prime name, 
based on examinations and supervisory inform
ation.  It was the general feeling of the 3/15/77 - 36 - 
    [sub]committee that we should follow in good c
onscience the normal workings of the prime 
mechanism in the market place, not deal in what the market classifies as nonprime, and very 

rarely, if ever, use our special knowledge of an individual bank™s condition to question the use of its acceptance or the purchase or repurc
hase agreement for its acceptance.   
And that™s a general statement of the issues, Mr. Chairman, and the [sub]committee™s 
recommendation to the FOMC. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, thank you very mu
ch for your report and for the work that you™ve done in connection with it.  Does the Co
mmittee want to discuss?  There are several 
recommendations, Mr. Kimbrel you have a--  
MR. KIMBREL.  Just a question, Mr. Chairman.  Timing really must have come into the 
discussion--with these exceptional cases or delicate banking structure--that you resolved to your own satisfaction. MR. GARDNER.  I think we did, Monroe, basically by the majority view that we no 
longer would purchase directly because, when we use the repurchase agreement, we have an 
additional point in strength.  And therefore, the issue to which I think you™re alluding would probably be of minimal importance. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Mayo, please, and then Mr. Coldwell. MR. MAYO.  I note at the bottom of page 1 
of the report of the subcommittee that one member of the subcommittee, namely Governor
 Gardner, favored continuation of outright System operations within recent limits and so fort
h.  I find myself somewhat sympathetic to that 
point of view--although there are no reasons as such given in the footnote--for a reason that doesn™t appear really in the memorandum anywhere
.  We have in Chicago a development, which 
is still in its infancy, to enc
ourage the development of a bankers™ acceptances market in Chicago 
which would be, in some phases at least, independent of the market in New York; maybe 
independent isn™t the right word, but it would be able to stand on its own feet.  Our banks feel that there are certain advantages
 in this in terms of physical 
transfer of bankers™ acceptances, 
which, of course, are trade-related, and we have a great deal of interna
tional trade going out of Chicago, and it™s growing.   The main reason that I can remember that we
 encouraged the contin
uation of the bankers™ acceptances operation at the Fed earlier was to in 
effect nurture a market which hadn™t developed 
as well as perhaps we thought it might develop.  
Maybe that is true in New York.  It hasn™t developed as well as I think it should in Chicago, and there may be other centers, such as, for instance, San Francisco, where this sort of development might be on the horizon.   
Adoption of the subcommittee™s report, I reali
ze, does not close the door on the possibility that there might be some way in which the Fe
deral Reserve Banks, in areas where a bankers™ 
acceptances market is developing in the future, coul
d participate in that.  But I am inclined to 
think that it would be easier to do it under the adoption of Steve™s favored plan here, rather than the plan as recommended by the full subcommittee. 
3/15/77 - 37 - 
    MR. GARDNER.  Well, I can only say, Bob, th
at the [sub]committee did not address the 
implications of an incipient growth of regiona
l new markets of acceptances.  Perhaps we were 
over-awed by the size of New York, and the fact is, we didn™t think of your particular point as we deliberated. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr
. Coldwell, please. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I found my
self perfectly compatible with the 
majority™s recommendations on this matter.  I 
think it does leave--with the intention of the 
authority that™s in the directive--the possibility of reopening.  I would not be too sympathetic 
with the idea of using the Open Market Desk as a means of fostering regional markets.  I think 
we could get into some problems there, but with 
that caveat, I™m perfectly happy with the results 
of the subcommittee. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have no difficulty with
 the report of the [sub]committee, but I do 
have a question on one point, and that is, let me 
read paragraph [unintelligible] on page 8 of the [sub]committee™s report.  ﬁThe FO
MC also may want to consider 
the term prime as applied to 
acceptances described in the Authorization for Dome
stic Open Market Operations.  In the view 
of the account management, with which we woul
d concur, the Desk should be guided by prudent 
investment principles and cr
edit standards.ﬂ  So far, so good; I have no question.   But then I do have a question about what follows:  ﬁbut should not feel obliged to automatically refuse to execute a repurchase 
agreement against the bank™s acceptance because it 
received some information which may raise a 
question about the financial stature of the accepting bank.ﬂ  And then it goes on, ﬁthe word pr
ime should be used to describe acceptances 
of banks which are known to have confidence in the field of ac
ceptance financing and acceptances which have established a reputation for 
freely trading in the market.ﬂ  I think that 
there™s a touch of ambiguity here.  I may be visua
lizing a difficulty that doesn™t exist.  I think the 
Desk ought to accept the judgment of the market. 
MR. PARTEE.  That™s what this says. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it™s not the way 
I interpreted Mr. Gardner™s--Mr. Gardner 
left an opening for the Desk to use its judgment. 
MR. GARDNER.  Well, I™d hope not to give the implication that there isn™t--the opening 
that I believe should exist, Mr. Chairman, is th
e fact that we were buying Franklin National™s bankers™ acceptances too close to the day that 
Franklin National became a problem.  Now, I 
shouldn™t be talking about what the Desk was doing at a period of time when I wasn™t here.   
Nevertheless, the purpose of the paragraph was to mean that we may 
classify in our own examination process some major banks who have
 perfect confidence in the acceptance market 
and general marketability--we may find some probl
ems in those banks as we look over their day-
to-day operations.  The Desk should be guided, in our view, by the mark
et™s perception.  Of course, there could be a case where a major ba
nk or an accepting bank is beyond repair.  And in such case, I think the Desk would have some di
fficulty.  And that™s the only opening I meant--  
3/15/77 - 38 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But at that point the Desk--here is my warning--the Desk should 
not act on its authority. MR. GARDNER.  I agree. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  If there is a question that the Desk has about a particular bank, then before it takes any action which deviates from market judgment, it 
should consult promptly 
with the Committee.  Unless that is done--unless there is such consultation, the possibility of real trouble-- MR. PARTEE.  That™s one of the major issues.  You see, if you™re buying outright and you have knowledge, why then you are in a conflict-of-interest sort of situation. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I know.  I think that™s good. MR. PARTEE.  If you™re dealing in RPs, it™s a financing mechanism.  It seems to me you 
can very readily just take the market™s judgment 
for the collateral you accept for the RPs.  That™s 
one of the reasons I supported the majority view of the [sub]committee rather than Governor 
Gardner™s view. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question or comment?  Yes, Mr. Volcker. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just very briefly, Mr. Chairman.  I don™t feel strongly 
about this issue.  I get a little
 nostalgic about this long traditio
n of the acceptance market that the 
System explicitly nurtured, and it™s in the la
w.  On the other hand, there™s an element of 
artificiality at this point when we operate the way we do, and here™s this credit problem.  But I do think it™s wise to keep in the authorization and 
at least bow out in easy steps and continue to do the repurchase agreements thing. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I sense an at
titude of acceptance of the subcommittee™s 
report.  Am I interpreting the Committee™s thinking 
correctly?  Well, we can take a formal vote.  
Any dissent?  There is none.  Then the Committ
ee™s unanimous.  And we haven™t done badly.  It™s only 5 minutes after one.
