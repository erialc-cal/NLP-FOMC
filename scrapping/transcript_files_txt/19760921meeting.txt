September 21, 1976 
 
 CHAIRMAN  BURNS.  We can get our 
meeting under way if someone will be good 
enough to move approval of the minutes of the August meeting. 
MR. COLDWELL.  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion made and second
ed.  I hear no objections.  Let us turn therefore to Mr. Holmes™s report 
on recent foreign developments.   
MR. HOLMES.  [Secretary's note: This statement was not found in Committee records.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Holmes.  
Are there any questions?  Very well, is 
there a motion to approve the tran
sactions of the Foreign Desk? SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The motion is made, th
ere is no objection.  And the credit that we™ve extended to Mexico has recently been
 renegotiated in conn
ection with a further commitment made by the U.S. Treasury.  All this
 took place over a hectic weekend and was not concluded until early Monday morning. The foreign 
currency subcommittee acted in behalf of 
the full Committee; there was simply no physical oppor
tunity to deliberate with this Committee.  
And when you get into one of these negotiations, there is really nothing to deliberate over until the very end because positions are not clearly defi
ned or keep changing.  That™s the nature, I™m 
afraid, of the beast.  Mr. Wallich will report on the outcome of these negotiations. 
MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, the Mexicans a
lmost a month ago presented a pretty grim 
picture of their situation to 
the Treasury, with hints of the possibility of a moratorium on 
[payments on] their foreign debt.  They™ve sin
ce moved in a much more
 constructive direction, made an agreement with the IMF, made an agreement with the Treasury and us, and set 

themselves on the policy course that hopefully w
ill get them out of trouble over time--at any rate, 
avoid anything on the order of a moratorium.   
So far, we™ve had a sharp devaluation of the Mexican peso, which brought back about a $190 million reflow.  They then, however, raised 
the rate again in orde
r to give their wage 
negotiations, which are critical, an assist; as a result,
 they lost more than they had taken in.  This 
is an important feature of the situation.  As 
soon as the wage negotiations are out of the way, then they will be free to let the 
rate find [a] better level again.   The agreement with the IMF is under the highe
st conditionality that the IMF has for the extended facility.  They draw first their regular credit tranche, plus the so-called compensatory 
facility which has little conditionality; but neve
rtheless the conditionality relating to the whole 
agreement is intended to apply to 
this part also.  Then [they] 
draw over three years on amounts of 
$235 million per year under the extended facility, 
giving them in the aggregate [an] amount well 
over $1 billion.   9/21/76 - 2 - 
 Now the Treasury and possibly the Federal Reserve engage in a pre-financing of some of 
these drawings.  The first part, the credit tranche plus the compensatory facility, amount to 
$365 million.  The Treasury has offered a pre-fina
ncing in which the Federal Reserve, in the 
manner in which I will explain, is a 
potential participant.  The exp
ectation is that the money from 
the IMF will come in around November 1.  That w
ould mean that the Mexicans get this money 
for a matter of 35 to 40 days, and the financing w
ould be paid off from that IMF money.  Further 
installments of pre-finance by the Treasury [w
ould come] then in three annual installments 
during 1977.  The Federal Reserve has nothing to do with that.   As regards our own participation, the arrangement is the following: the Mexicans are given [two] option[s]. [In the first,] they maintain 
their present swap position of $360 [million] until 
it™s due on October 9, and [then they] pay us off.  Steve Gardner and I have talked to them, and 
we have some impression that there is consid
erable goodwill.  It was strengthened in later conversation, I guess today, that they will do ev
erything possible to repa
y at that time.   
Alternatively, [under option two] they would integrate up to one-half of the 360, that is 180, into the Treasury arrangement.  That would m
ean that they have to prepay the swap and immediately redraw--it™s the same swap but a 
separate drawing.  They repay immediately,  
redraw, and the new drawing would be under the 
same conditions that apply to the Treasury 
[financing].  The advantage there from our point of view is that the Treasury has a firm takeout 
from the IMF for its pre-financing; if we could ge
t into that, we [would] have the same takeout.  
The advantage to the Mexicans is that they keep that money a little longer instead of having to 
repay on October 9.  They`d be repaying whenever the IMF money comes in, around November 
1.  So we think that we have at least [potentially] improved our pos
ition with respect to the swap.  
If the Mexicans take this option, then we have a takeout for one-half of the money, although it 
comes back three weeks later.  
If they don™t take the option, well, then we are in the same 
position we were in to begin with, with 
this maturity coming up on October 9.   
Now, one has to see that operation in proportion.  The Mexicans have an enormous current 
account deficit, and merely to finance that defi
cit of about $3 billion a year they must be 
borrowing something like $250 million a month from the international capital market.  In 

addition, of course, they have maturities, so th
ey™ve got to refinance by additional borrowings.  
So they™re in the world capital markets continuous
ly.  Our [part] of the Treasury™s operation is financially rather small for them.  It™s crucial for them in the sense that they want to establish 

their credit, they want to show a solid position to
 their creditors.  And one element of doing that 
is not to draw on this facility that the Treasury 
and the Fed are offering to repay the swap if they possibly can [avoid it], and to make their affairs 
look as normal as possible in these conditions.   
Fundamentally, the devaluation has eased 
their position by laying the basis for the 
improvement of the balance of payments.  Very 
much depends of course on the kind of policies they follow.  There are some reasonable doubts 
about those policies because they involve an undertaking to avoid a decline in real wages.  My impression is that that undertaking isn™t being 
taken all that literally, and it would be very difficult to implement it.   
The agreement with the IMF is 
such that the IMF appears to be fully satisfied and is 
prepared to give them this credit, which they can
 do only if they are satisfied with the program.  
They™ve also certified this to the Treasury, and you have a copy, I believe, of the letter from 
9/21/76 - 3 - 
 [IMF Managing Director] Witteveen certifying this to the Treasury.  There is another letter from 
the Mexican Secretary of the Treasury confirmi
ng the arrangement.  We have to wait until 
October 9 to see whether the Mexicans pick up their option under the swap to go in on the undertaking with the Treasury. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich. 
 Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. 
MacLaury. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Can I ask Governor Wallich, 
is the certification of
 Witteveen in some 
sense [similar to] the indications of the [U.S.] Co
mptroller of the Currency as to the viability or 
solvency of banks?  That™s one question, 
and the second one is do we have any-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You have an answer to that question.  I don™t think we ought to say one word about it.  We all know what it means. 
MR. MACLAURY.  The other question was--maybe
 that will then rest as a rhetorical 
question--in our swap drawings, there™s no question 
as to the fact that there will be no exchange 
losses to the Federal Reserve in the repayment of
 these drawings?  No sp
litting of losses or anything? MR. WALLICH.  The latter is correct, and I w
ould like to add that this certification of 
Witteveen does represent a carefully negotiated program.  Now, I gather that the Chairman is 

somewhat skeptical of this program when you cons
ider that the British are very much concerned 
about the political implications of getting that 
certification from Witteve
en.  I think one has to 
concede that there is some reality to that [concern].   
Moreover, there is an opportunity to impl
ement the conditionality.  The money doesn™t 
come all at once, they can™t walk away with it, 
thumb their nose.  It comes over three years, and 
any time they don™t meet the stipulations, they don™
t get it.  The ultimate test of this is that 
balance sheet numbers are specified on the balanc
e sheet of the Bank of Mexico [unintelligible] unless the credit expands. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Is there any reluctance on the part of the capital markets to provide 
the funds that the Mexicans continue seeking? MR. WALLICH.  They say that [there is] not. 
 They say that they recently received an 
offer of $1 billion--and the inclination was to say, ﬁWhy don™
t you grab that?ﬂ--which they 
turned down because it would have
 [involved] irregular procedures.  They borrow in $1/4 billion 
lots and they want to go on doing that. MR. PARDEE.  I have a kind of answer to that question.  We were talking to people in the 
market on that.  As soon as they devalued, the Me
xicans called a number of the U.S. banks to see 
if they could get additional credit lines and did obtain some credit lines with New York banks.  
Several of the people in New York say that the image of Mexico is somewhat tarnished 
[regarding] borrowings.  So they may say they™re ge
tting a lot of money, but it™s on the basis of a 
major effort they have made, and, as I say, this word ﬁtarnishedﬂ has come up. 
MR. JACKSON.  Is it possible that this is the ultimate enforcer of their programs? 
9/21/76 - 4 - 
 MR. WALLICH.  Their inability to borrow in-- 
MR. JACKSON.  The continuing monthly needs 
will be supplied only to the extent that 
they can qualify-- MR. WALLICH.  That may very well be, becau
se that™s where the most [of the] money 
comes from. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Of course, that carries with it the danger that, instead of adjusting 
their policies and moving in a constructive fina
ncial direction, they may declare a moratorium 
and continue to do business at home politically 
the way they have.  So there is a lot of 
uncertainty in it. 
MR. JACKSON.  To declare a morato
rium when you need $200 million a month 
additional? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t know the exact figures, but there is a repayments 
schedule, and then you don™t need to repay and you don™t need to pay interest on the outstanding bill, and you don™t need to amortize or repay on 
the due date.  How these figures come out, I 
don™t know; they may come out exactly 
as I have suggested, maybe not.   
Gentlemen, no action, as far as I can see, is
 required by the Committee.  We have this 
renegotiation, and as a result of it we are no worse off, and we may be si
gnificantly better off.  Any further question or comment?   
All right, let™s pass to the Manager™s r
ecommendations.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich, for your 
report and for the fine job you and Mr. Gardner did on negotiating with the Mexicans. MR. WALLICH.  I think we could give cred
it also to the Treasury, which steered the 
Mexicans in a good direction. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right. 
MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, the Bank of En
gland™s two drawings of $100 million each 
under the swap will be up for their first renewal on September 23 and September 30.  It had 

earlier been understood that the drawings woul
d be renewable only until December 9, when the 
British had agreed to arrange borrowing from the IM
F.  It is my understanding that the Bank of 
England is determined to pay their drawings
 under the swap on time even though IMF money 
may not be available until later in the month.  
I therefore recommend renewal on the two swap 
drawings until December 9.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any questions?  All righ
t, I take it that the recommendation is 
approved.  Anything else, Mr. Holmes? 
MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, turning to our 
Swiss franc indebtedness, last week in 
Basel we negotiated a plan with the Swiss National Bank for a possible refunding of our swap debt and a definite quarterly repayment schedule, which would settle the debt within three years.  9/21/76 - 5 - 
 The plan is subject to appr
oval by the Swiss National Bank board and of course by this Committee.   
The negotiations also cover the plan for Treasury repayment of their Swiss franc bonds 
concurrently over a three-year period, and the Treasury is in full agreement with the proposal.  
Total U.S. debt to the Swiss National Bank amount
s to approximately 9.3 billion Swiss francs, or 
about $3.7 billion at current market
 rates.  Of this total, 3.9 billion Swiss francs represents our swap debt.  The Treasury has agreed to a somewhat faster paydown 
of our swap debt in the first year of the proposal, but final payments of both 
debts would come at the end of the three-year 
period.   As far as the [Federal Reserve] System is concerned, details are still to
 be worked out.  The proposal could involve the series of Swiss franc drawings outside the regular swap network, with the proceeds used immediately to pay off de
bt outstanding since 1971 under the old line.  Repayments would be made in scheduled quarterly 
installments.  We would make every effort to 
buy Swiss francs in the market, conditions permitt
ing, and on occasion to sell the Swiss National 
Bank other currencies that we have acquired and for which they have a need.   Finally, and this concession on the part of the 
Swiss is what will make the plan work, the 
Swiss have agreed to sell us directly at market rates against un
covered dollars any Swiss francs we need to enable us to meet our
 scheduled repayment obligations.   
The loss-sharing agreement reached
 earlier this year will remain in force, and the Swiss 
have extended it to cover the Treasury as well.  At current excha
nge rates, full repayment of our 
swap indebtedness will entail a loss of about
 $415 million, of which the Federal Reserve share 
would be $271 million.  Losses would be taken only
 as quarterly payments are made and so 
would be spread out over a three-year period.  Losses, of course, could either be more or less 
depending on market developments over the next 
three years, and I would certainly not by any means rule out the possibility that they could be less.   
Mr. Chairman, I recommend that the Committee 
approve in principle the proposal outlined 
above and that we proceed to work out the details with the Treasury and the Swiss National Bank.  In light of the fact that we do not have final Swiss agreement, I believe that final 
Committee action should await confirmation by the Ch
airman that such an agreement had been 
reached and details agreed on.  Th
at™s all I have, Mr. Chairman. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, first of all, I think you are to be congratulated on working out this agreement with the Swiss.  The proposal 
that Mr. Holmes is making has been put before 
you in writing.  You might read 
it, Mr. Broida, to make sure 
that we all know what it is. MR. BROIDA.  This is a proposed sp
ecial authorization.  It reads:  The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and 
directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
to arrange for repayment of the System™s outstanding swap commitments to the Swiss National Bank 

(concurrent with repayment by the U.S. Treasury of Treasury notes denominated in Swiss francs and held by 
the Swiss National Bank) within a thr
ee-year period by means of quarterly payments on a schedule that is 
mutually satisfactory to the Swiss National Bank, th
e U.S. Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.  This 
authorization shall become effective upon final approval
 of technical details by the Chairman of the Federal 
Open Market Committee. 
9/21/76 - 6 - 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any questions or comments?  Yes, Mr. Mayo. 
MR. MAYO.  Alan, is this schedule that we are talking about visualized as having some 
flexibility, or is it a 
fairly rigid schedule? MR. HOLMES.  I think it ought to--certainly we
 should have flexibility.  But I do think we ought to set up a schedule for ourselves and really try to stick as closely to it as we possibly can.  [If] overwhelming problems in the market or othe
r places [develop], sure, I think we [would] have to reconsider.  But I think there will be 
no problem in doing that with the Swiss National 
Bank. MR. MAYO.  I guess this is my question.  Th
e Swiss franc continue
s to be very strong, and this is a big chunk.  I just feel a little uneasy, myself, [about] our ability to do it at, quote, ﬁcurrent market rates.ﬂ 
MR. HOLMES.  Well, you know, we said that ea
rlier this year.  And the Swiss franc was at 2.60 [per dollar].  If we™d repaid then, our loss [would] be less 
than it is now.  So I don™t think we ought to take a risk [by hoping for] a favor
able development in the exchange rate, but 
[instead] get started even though it does cost us money and even though, if we waited for three 
years, we might do it more cheaply. 
 I think we ought to get going. MR. MAYO.  I fully subscribe to this.  I just have the uneasiness going along with the subscription. 
MR. PARDEE.  The Treasury still has all that gold that the swaps were entered into to 
protect, so the loss that we have now is the value of gold-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, this is
 a footnote.  It™s useful to remind ourselves of it.  But 
less and less attention is being paid by the rest of the world to that footnote.  We have to speak 
much more loudly even to be heard on this. 
MR. WALLICH.  Of course, to th
e extent that™s there more ri
sk in the later payments, we 
will have a little less risk by virtue of being able
 to pay about in proportion the first year, then of 
the second and third year, the Treasury taking the later installments in larger part. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, whether th
at™s good or bad, time will tell. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I assume 
this special agreement means that the 
Treasury is not going to develop that commitment
 or semicommitment that we thought we had. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would accept the conclu
sion.  I would not accept the language.  
The Treasury is unwilling to give up gold or SDRs. MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, I think the Trea
sury would be willing to take over our debt.  I think they would agree to that.  I think the Swiss would prefer to do it in the way we are 
suggesting here. 9/21/76 - 7 - 
 MR. COLDWELL.  But my question 
is not that so much as it is in [regard to] the future.  
Are we now without any backup from the Treasury on future swap drawings? MR. WALLICH.  I would not think so.  Our di
scussions were of the kind in which the Fowler letter was discussed.  It was treated with some irritatio
n, if I may say so, but not with 
total rejection. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would share Mr. Coldwell™s skepticism.  I think that the Fowler 
letter is unlikely to have much
 effect, if any, in the future. MR. COLDWELL.  In which case the net result of
 all this questioning is that we ought to plan our swap arrangements 
with the idea of no takeout. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  With the idea that ther
e was still a Treasury 
[backup] in case there is a serious problem for us; I think the Treasury w
ould take that into account.  But I don™t [think] 
we can count on getting gold or SDRs from the Tr
easury, and I think that™s a realistic view.  We 
can understand it. MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, that is a perfect
ly realistic view, but the alternative [was] 
having them take over our deficit, as Mr. Holmes
 said, and that was really the issue that one 
would discuss next time. 
MR. HOLMES.  I think another possibility might
 be discussed with the Treasury--I don™t 
know how successfully--and that is an IMF drawi
ng as takeout, because we certainly have had other countries do that.  We at least ought to consider it with our Treasury. MR. MACLAURY.  But in a floating [excha
nge rate] world, really you have to ask yourself what takeout with gold or with an IMF dr
awing or anything else in some sense means.  
It seems to me that what we would be talki
ng about now is, one, getting the debt off our books; but, second, the losses that we would incur as an 
institution in doing that.  
And if Henry and Alan are right, that the Treasury is prepared to take the debt off our hands at the rate at which it™s on our books, then we have as much of a guarantee, 
it seems to me, for both things as we had with 
the Fowler letter--which strikes me as being pr
etty much a dead letter philosophically, and not 
just by virtue of the course of events in the meantime. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let me make two comm
ents.  First, yes, to be sure, we have a floating regime, and the role of 
gold is quite different.  But it seemed to us for a time that we 
could more readily reach an agreement with th
e Swiss if some gold or SDRs were offered.  
That™s point number 1.  Point number 2, as 
far as the Treasury taking over any of our indebtedness to another central bank is concerned, I don™t think that we ought to leave the matter 
having the Committee think that [this] is going to 
happen.  It may or may not
 be going to happen.  I don™t know how to assess the probability. I doubt that anybody can at this time. 
[MR. HOLMES or MR. PARDEE.]  Mr. Chairman, at the Desk, I have been going under the assumption that we have no takeout and 
no assistance from the Treasury.  That every 
operation has to be self-liquidating in the exchange market, and every swap line liquidated 
throughout the operations in this-- 9/21/76 - 8 - 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think you™re proceeding 
on what I consider to be a very prudent 
course.  I think that™s the assumption that
 should be made.  Any other question? 
SPEAKER(?).  I [noted] a technical detail that
 you mentioned first o
ff, the [unintelligible] 
through their willingness to sell us [Swiss francs] SPEAKER(?).  Yes-- 

SPEAKER(?).  This is the thing, th
e very thing that makes it work. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I™ll tell you about technical details.  I was shown a piece of paper this morning which I refused to put be
fore the Committee because I didn™t understand it 
myself.  This, I understand. SPEAKER(?).  I consider that a little
 bit stronger than a technical detail. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that
 is really the heart of th
e agreement, not a technical 
detail. SPEAKER(?).  That wasn™t mentioned as brie
fly at [unintelligible] I™m perfectly happy 
with this solution because I understand [unintelligible]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you have a proposal before you written out on the sheet of paper that Mr. Broida read.  Is there a motion, or do we need 
more discussion of the proposal? SPEAKER(?).  Could I ask a question?  I™ve 
seen this before.  The word ﬁconcurrentﬂ simply means, broadly, that [uni
ntelligible] jointly with the Treas
ury but not does not specify any amounts? 
MR. HOLMES.  Not parallel but ending at the same time. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right,
 any other question or comments?  If not, is there a 
motion to approve the special authorization? SPEAKER(?).  So moved.   

SPEAKER(?).  Second. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Motion has been cautiously made and cautiously seconded, and in 
view of the caution exercised, may we have a voice vote.  All those [who] approve will kindly 
say aye. 
[NOTE.  Multiple responses: ﬁAye.ﬂ] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any no™s?  All righ
t, any other recommendation, Mr. Holmes? 
MR. HOLMES.  No. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are you going to be repaying the Belgians any money? 9/21/76 - 9 - 
 MR. HOLMES.  Yes, there is a possibility at th
e end of this month. They have a large debt to pay to the Germans, and we might conceiva
bly pay off the whole thing by the end of this month--I would say, though, at a very poor excha
nge rate, so we do want to see if we can 
improve that rate a little bit.  
We™ll be working on that the next 
few days.  It™s uncertain right at this moment, but we will continue to make 
progress and maybe get rid of the whole thing. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think this should be a happy day for us because we finally are in the process of getting rid of our indebtedness.  Let™s turn to the economic outlook.  Mr. 
Zeisel, would you be good enough to report to the Committee? 
MR. ZEISEL.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Zeisel.  This is the time for members of the 
Committee to express their views on the economic
 condition of the country and the outlook for our national economy.  Mr. Eastburn will speak first. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Just one comment.  As 
I™ve compared the quantitative information, 
such as that in the Greenbook, with qualitative comments being made by businessmen and 
others, I think there™s a considerable difference.  The qualitative information is more pessimistic 
than the other.  I just wonder whether this is your experience too.  Second, whether you see this as some kind of a forecast [with] less bullishness-- 
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, the more negative quali
tative reports that I™ve heard have been largely from the retail sales area, particularly from those chains that concentrate on nondurable goods.  And they have every reason to feel somewh
at depressed.  The rate of growth in these sales has been very weak in recent months, but there has been a significant pickup there--and if things continue to rise as we expect they will, I think they will have a somewhat brighter outlook 
in the near future.  They remain very cautious, obviously.   
Otherwise I really haven™t heard much that
 I would characterize 
as negative--rather, cautious [instead]--and I think this has probably been a very good thing.  It™s resulted in a very careful attitude toward 
inventory investment, which has kept 
things well in line there and I think 
keeps the economy in a position to 
move ahead as final demands incr
ease, as I think they will.  Are there any specific areas that you can put your finger on? MR. EASTBURN.  One of our directors in chemicals, for ex
ample, was discouraged about 
the current [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Thank 
you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Kimbrel, please. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, I™m concerne
d how staunchly Mr. Zeisel [would] support the prices [projection]--5 to 5-1/2 [unintelligib
le] I guess is limited only by food and energy.  If 
these wage rates should start picking up and if these industrial price hikes stand, I wonder how strongly he feels that [unintelligible] thes
e numbers look pretty good at 5 to 5-1/2.   
MR. ZEISEL.  I think they are fairly reasonable.  For the near term, it appears that food 
prices are likely to continue to be rather moderate and in 
fact possibly to continue down 9/21/76 - 10 - 
 somewhat.  The outlook for meat prices looks 
pretty good.  This may mean somewhat larger 
rises in 1977, but it is hard to project the food area that far ahead.   As far as other sectors are concerned, in terms of cost, our pro
ductivity performance has 
been really quite good.  The rate of increase in productivity over the last half year has been in the 5-1/2 percent range, and unit labor costs have been between 3 and 3-1/2 percent, which has been moderate, certainly, [relative to] performance of the last couple 
of years and I think does not suggest undue pressure on prices.  The key--w
e anticipate continued good gains in productivity, obviously not as strong as we™ve had, but we do 
think that this will be a factor limiting the 
increase of prices.   The area, of course, that disturbs us is energy prices.  They have been rising very rapidly, but we think that this period of rebound--after all, there was a decline in energy prices, and this is a period of adjustment upward, and that appears 
to be coming to an end, and we see fairly 
moderate increases in energy prices ahead. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are you taking into account what OPEC is likely to do in December? 
MR. ZEISEL.  We have built in a one dollar increase per barrel of oil, Mr. Chairman.  It™s 
certainly possible, and we are considering the likelihood of a dollar and a half increase in oil prices. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Intelligence 
reports are very strong on this issue, suggesting a 10 
to 15 percent rise. MR. ZEISEL.  A 15 percent increase rather than a 10 percent increase, by our calculations, 
would affect the consumer price index by only 1/10 of
 1 percent.  It would not be a major factor.  If things get no worse than that, I would hold with our forecast fo
r energy prices.  Over the next 
few months, I think some of the pressures on 
gasoline will be diminishing.  We have passed 
through the period of greatest demand this summer, and in fact there have been a few indications 
of price reductions in gasoline.  I think we 
will see at least some easing of prices after 
September.  I think, overall, give
n perspectives that we have now, it seems to us that the 5 to 
5-1/2 percent range is a reasonable one. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Jerry, does your forecast of 
only 1/10 percent of CPI just look at the 
direct impact of the price changes in gasoline or is
 that filtering back to 
the prices elsewhere in 
the economy? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Includ
ing the outside economy. 
MR. ZEISEL.  My impression is
 that it™s a total effect. 
MR. COLDWELL.  I have a 
hard time believing--  
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, the difference betw
een 10 and 15--excuse me, I didn™t quite 
understand.  The effect of a 15 percent increase would be something in the neighborhood of 
about 3/10. 9/21/76 - 11 - 
 MR. COLDWELL.  I hope you™re right. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Don™t make this calc
ulation available to OPEC.  Thank you, Mr. Kimbrel.  Mr. Winn now, please. 
MR. WINN.  In the housing area, Mr. Chairm
an, I think we would make a mistake not 
factoring in the home remodeling and renovation
 expenditures.  In ™73, I understand, single homes were running around $47 billion and home re
modeling was about 18.  Apparently they™re 
estimating on a single home now 43 or somethi
ng like that and estimating remodeling would be 
30 some odd, which is a very big factor.  And 
I understand that the changes in FHA requirements 
on the [unintelligible].  I understand that this reduces the interest cost about 2 percentage points, and that makes a difference in terms of multifamily
 dwellings because interest is such a large 
cost in their construction, and some people [
unintelligible] get 7 to 7-1/2 percent money. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  This is under the Tandem plan? 
MR. WINN.  Yes, this is going to make a difference to multifamily construction.  The 
second comment I would make would be [that th
e] machine tool business has shown the same 
lag [unintelligible] in construction as the energy area.  This has been very weak.  They™re projecting a 10 percent price increase, with only about a 6 percent increase in cost, which makes 
their margins a lot better.  Business had dropped o
ff for about two months prior to the trade show 
in Chicago last week, and they were expecting that to be a big turn, and it happens to be in that area. 
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, the machine tool series 
has begun to rise and shows a significantly more rapid increase--of course, as you know, it™s quite a small proportion of the total, between 1 and 2 percent of purchases of nonelectrical machinery.  You™re pe
rfectly right on the repairs and additions, and we have built in a very strong rate of
 increase.  We have been aware that this has 
been a strong element of support for activity. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I thank you, Mr. Winn.  Mr. Black, please. 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Zeisel, looking at these two green tables, the first one in the Greenbook, I™m struck by the capacity utilization 
projections you have made [and] the pretty 
rapid increase in industrial production related to the relatively slow growth in manufacturing 
employment.  I was wondering if you™ve made any e
xplicit projections in the way of behavior of unit labor costs. MR. ZEISEL.  Yes, we have such projections for the total nonfarm economy, not for 
manufacturing.  However, there are implicit produc
tivity projections for manufacturing.  For the 
nonfarm economy, our projections of productivity call 
for a much more moderate rate of increase 
than we have had.  As I indicated, the rate of increase in the first half of this year shows 5-1/2 percent.  We expect it to drop down to 3 
percent or a slightly under 3 percent range for the remainder of the projection period.  This would be
 slightly above the long-term trend.  And we 
feel [we are being] consistent with a rate of growth of real ou
tput in the roughly 5 to a little above 5 percent range.   9/21/76 - 12 - 
 In terms of unit labor costs, they have been 
running slightly over 3 percent.  That™s a function of the very rapid productivity gains which are typical in the early stages of recovery.  The unit labor costs will be edging up a bit.  As I remembered them, they are in the slightly 

above 4 percent range. MR. BLACK.  By the end of ™77? 
MR. ZEISEL.  They are in the middle-4 range 
at the end of ™77--about 4-1/2 percent for the second half of 1977 for unit labor costs.  This is in conjunction with a productivity increase of about 2.8, 2.9, and compensation increases during that period of about 7-1/2 percent. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Morris, please. MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with th
e staff™s economic projections.  I do have a 
question, however, and that is, it seems to me th
at this Committee over the next couple of years 
will need all of the intelligence 
it can get on the question of price expectations.  And in this 
regard I want to ask the staff whether it thought it would be useful to include in the Greenbook a section analyzing what™s going on in the futures markets for basic commodities, both food and 
nonfood.  And also whether it would be useful to analyze whether we could get any kind of intelligence of note through analyzi
ng what™s going on in this new Treasury bill futures market. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would think that while what you suggest is useful, we might 
supplement it and perhaps even learn more by ha
ving Mr. Mayo do a special exercise for us, the way he did earlier on another problem on capacity, and canvas our directors on their price expectations.  Mr. Zeisel, please. MR. ZEISEL.  Well, we would be delighted t
o.  We do keep an eye on these prices, of course.  I™d be delighted to prepare some analysis, although it te
nds, as you know, to be a fairly volatile kind of area, and it™s a little difficult to 
interpret short-term movements.  But we™ll take 
this under consideration, review the numbers, and see whether we can make something 
meaningful out of this and provide such an analysis.  
MR. AXILROD.  On the Treasury bill futures, 
President Morris, we™ve been keeping track 
of that market as its volume ha
s grown.  In the early days, it was a very limited market, and we 
can report [on it] when it™s of interest.  My im
pression most recently is that it™s not telling us 
anything very different than reading [forward] rates out of th
e government securities market 
proper.  We have been keeping rather close 
track on it.  And to the extent it can reveal 
differences or trends, we will report back. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, would you expect any differences? MR. AXILROD.  I wouldn™t really expect any differences. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Theoretically they should be identical because they are the same 
phenomenon. 
MR. AXILROD.  Theoretically they should be identical.  Sometimes there have been some 
differences recently-- 9/21/76 - 13 - 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well--which would suggest that the participants in the two markets are not quite the same--the
y think a little differently.  But 
such a difference is not likely 
to persist very long. MR. AXILROD.  As the volume has grown and familiarity with the market has grown, 
these differences [unintelligible] have tended to dissipate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Baughman, please. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I question 
first the different signals from the 
household survey and the nonfarm payroll employme
nt data on employment last month--will you 
draw any particular significance from that in terms of tre
nd of employment, or not?   
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, I™m afraid we can™t.  I wi
sh I could put my finger on which of the two 
series I believe [for] last month, but I can™t.  I™d say the problem has always been that, for any 
given month, there may be a difference in the way 
the two series behave.  And the thing to do is to watch them over a several-month period.   
The thing that gives me 
a little bit of confidence about what the payroll series is signaling is the fact that there were two months in 
a row of fairly good gains in nonfarm payroll 
employment, accumulating to half a million, and that™s a rather impressive number.  We™ll just 

have to wait and see.  I think that, over a longer period, the two series do tend to follow pretty 
much the same paths.  They both slowed down 
considerably after the spring.  As you remember, 
the household series rose quite strongly the previous month while the payroll series rose this 
month--I think at the moment I™
m willing to at least accept the fact that the payroll series 
suggests that employers are adding to their staffs. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  I could make a couple of comments, Mr. Chairman, with respect to 
the local impact of the devaluation of the pe
so.  I may say that the action which has been 
taken--and I didn™t find it reported in the Wall Street Journal this morning, but I assume it will 
be recorded very soon--will be very welcome 
news soon along the border.  We had been 
receiving a fair number of telephone calls, primarily
 from banks on the U.S. side of the border, 
indicating something like this was very much 
needed, because there was a rising feeling of 
uncertainty, particularly on the part of Mexican nationals of significant wealth.  Of course, as you know, runs on banks were developing, and some 
banks were having to close early because 
they ran out of currency.  And in our own shop, we saw return flow for a few days, but then it turned right around, and we™re now shipping sizable volumes again 
to Mexico as they undertake to respond to that sort of development.   
We™ve had some reports from business firms of 
cancellation of orders for capital goods as 
a result of the reduced purchasing power of the peso.  Of course, the merchants along the border 
who were serving a sizable Mexican trade [h
ave seen] their sales 
drop very sharply, and presumably they are looking at a very awkward inve
ntory situation.  It™s interesting that some of 
them have apparently chosen to run ads in Me
xican papers in which they offered higher-than-market prices for pesos rather than reductions
 in prices of mercha
ndise as a merchandising 
device.   9/21/76 - 14 - 
 We have reports that Mexican officials have closed some Mexican businesses that did not 
take their advice to resist temptations to mark up prices 
of merchandise.  We don™t have any 
indication as to whether that is widespread at all.  We do have re
ports from U.S. bankers of quite a bit of what you might call su
itcase money moving across [the 
border] and opening accounts in U.S. banks, apparently in response to a rumor 
that deposit accounts in Mexico might well be 
frozen and the border closed to movements of cu
rrency.  But, again, announcement of the actions 
taken yesterday I believe would bring substantial stability to that situation. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Those are very interesting comments.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  
Mr. Wallich, please. 
MR. WALLICH.  Looking at investment expe
nditures as they are projected, would you say they are more or less on track given the determinants as we know them and as we evaluate 
them?  Or are they significantly under what we woul
d expect them to be at
 given capacity, given the rate of growth of the economy, given the fi
nancial availability, profits, and so forth? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Before you answer that, I would like to refine the question.  The 
question may be interpreted in terms of leve
ls--actual and prospective business capital 
expenditures--or the question may be interpreted 
in terms of recent and prospective rates of 
change in capital expenditures.  And the two answ
ers are going to be very different.  You will 
have to refine the question before you answer it, or possibly answer both.  The question on both interpretations. 
MR. ZEISEL.  Well, as you know, the rate of grow
th has been a laggard series or area in the recovery, but it™s beginning to move in a patte
rn that seems more sensible.  And the rate of 
increase in business fixed investme
nt in real terms was about 8 perc
ent last quarter; we expect it to be rising from here, if we™re right, into the 
12 to 14 percent rate range, which would be, again, a reasonable rate of increase, although coming rather late in
 the recovery.   The other dimension, which is the 
level of investments, of course
 is another matter.  In real 
terms, investment has not recovered.  It remains we
ll below earlier rates, a
nd in that sense we can consider this to be a sector which is still depressed in a sense.  ﬁDepressedﬂ may be a strong 
word, but still relatively low compared to what 
it should be in terms of the contributions to 
building capital stock. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, tha
nk you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Balles, please. 
MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I™d like to make several comments and then ask a question 
about the economic outlook that was presented by
 the staff.  Generally speaking, I can accept 
that outlook as being certainly a reasonable and plausible one, but I would also have to add that, in my opinion, it probably has more downside risk now than we™ve seen in recent months, and 

for several reasons.   First of all, you mentioned, Mr. 
Zeisel, with regard to the outlook as you briefed us on it, that there were two principal risk
s--an extended auto strike and a renewal of stronger inflationary pressures.  Well, with regard to th
at first point, I think it™s quite possible that even if the strike is 
short, it could certainly change the quarter-by-quarter pattern of the output of the economy.  I™ve 
asked my staff to do a little looking back into th
e record.  In 1970, which was the last strike we 9/21/76 - 15 - 
 had, it lasted 70 days.  That was the strike against GM, and it had a very noticeable effect of cutting real output by an estimated
 3-1/2 to 4 percent at an annual rate between the second and the fourth quarters of 1970.   Now, how deeply this Ford st
rike is going to cut into the output of goods and services obviously is going to depend on the length.  My staff took a look at the 1967 Ford strike, lasting 49 days, and that took nearly 2 percentage points off the growth rate of real output in the affected quarters.  It™s our best guess that a short strike, let™s say two to three weeks, would probably have the effect of reducing real GNP [growth] by about 1 percentage point at the most, but if the thing 
went on for, say, six or seven weeks, it could reduce real output [growth] in the fourth quarter by 2 to 2-1/2 percentage points.   Now the only good news, I suppose, in this look at the record is that most
 of the real output lost during the strike seems to be made up in th
e quarter following the end of the strike, but even if that™s true, and if the strike, contrary to my 
hopes, should last longer than a couple of weeks, we could have a pretty soft tone, I would think, in the economy during the first quarter [of 1977], or the fourth quarter of this year, even though we might see a strong 
bounceback in the first quarter.   So one of the questions, I guess, that I would like to put to you if you™ve had a chance to look into this is, what duration of strike would you consider to be of sufficient magnitude to have 
a significant effect on the tone of the economy?   
I™ll let you think about that for a minute while 
I go on with the second comment, and that™s 
the outlook for inflation.  I must say that most 
of our industrial directors at the San Francisco Bank and its Branches continue to be skeptical of the outlook for inflation as you have outlined 

it--and with which my staff is 
in essential agreement.   
Whether [the directors] will be right or whethe
r the research staff will be right remains to 
be determined, but at least as fa
r as the psychology and the expectations in a number of segments 
of industry [are concerned], they expect the cost-push pressures to be stronger and the price increases to be more widespread than our research 
staffs are inclined to believe will be the case.  
And if nothing else, it indicates a frame of mind in a number of 
segments of industry that is 
going to affect their actual decisionmaking proc
esses, I think, whether it™s going to be on the inventory front or on the capital front.   So much for my comments, Mr. Chairman, a
nd if Mr. Zeisel has any answer to the question I pose on how long an auto strike would be serious enough, say, to cause us to bend in our policy, I™d like to hear this response. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m going to give Mr. Zeis
el a little more time to think over that 
question while I comment on your fi
rst question.  Exactly 20 years ago I made a rather extensive 
study, a very careful statistical study of the effects of major or long stri
kes on the economy, and I 
took the strikes in the railroad industry, in the coal industry, and in the steel industry for this purpose.  These are industries [in which] the effects may be reasonably expected to be 
nationwide.   9/21/76 - 16 - 
 I don™t recall precisely the period of the strike that I took for the purpose of my analysis, 
but I™m quite--it was longer than a month.  And 
the result was that, when you examine charts 
drawn to a liberal scale, unless you knew the precise time when a strike occurred in any one of 
these industries, you have [unintelligible] great difficulty determining that from the chart. 
MR. MORRIS.  The 1959 steel strike must have b
een such an exception. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I made this 
study in 1956, 20 years ago, and I have not studied it since, and maybe conditions are differe
nt, but I went back a good many years, and I 
thought it would be of interest on this occasion.   
While you live through one of these strikes, you go through all kinds of anxieties.  But they don™t last more than a month or two, and the eff
ects are rather minimal and more in men™s minds 
than in reality.  That was the conclusion I drew at that time, and I ha
ve no doubt that it was a correct conclusion at that time.  About the past
 20 years, I™m not going to comment.  I haven™t 
studied the question.  Mr. Zeisel, you™ve had time to reflect now and-- 
MR. ZEISEL.  I was listening to you, Mr. Chairman.  And may I add my visceral, if 
nothing else, reaction [regarding] the last 20 years to your earlier analysis--I agree with you completely.  I can™t recall a strike that we didn™
t overestimate the impact of.  Even that steel 
strike, we thought the world was coming to 
an end and it really quite didn™t.   But that™s sort of a general statement.  In sp
ecific terms, it seems to us that a strike of 
something over a month would be necessary before
 you really felt any significant impact.  The 
response to a Ford strike and a GM strike seems 
to be very different.  Obviously, there is the 
tremendous difference in the volume of production 
and impact, but beyond that, in our analysis 
of the past several strikes, the spillover, that is the demand for other model cars, seemed to be 
quite large during the Ford strike, and in effect the total loss in consumer sales tends to be 
relatively small. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there™s that, and there™s also the effect on the used car 
market-- 
MR. ZEISEL.  Right. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --and that, in turn, with the run-up in prices on used cars when the 
strike is over, there would be a rebound in purchases of the new cars.  Because the differential, you see, has become adverse. 
MR. ZEISEL.  For the 1967 Ford strike, which was for nine weeks, our estimate was that 
the actual loss in sales--that is, the loss forever--w
as really quite small.  There were two kinds of 
offsets.  One was a shift to other models, the 
second was purchasing later.  And our calculation was that the loss was only in th
e neighborhood of, oh, possibly half 
a million units in total during 
the entire period.   There are a couple of factors operating to moderate the early
 effects of the strike.  Producers of component parts and materials c
ontinue manufacturing on the assumption that 
Ford, when it starts up again, is going to be running flat out to make up. 
 Number 1.  Number 2, 
9/21/76 - 17 - 
 Ford this time had a much longer 
lead time in anticipating the likeli
hood of a strike than they did last time.  Last time, I think, they were told the 
day before the strike that they were going to be hit.  This time they™ve had enough time to build 
up stock, and our estimates are that there is a 
fairly good stock of cars in dealers™ hands at this point.   As far as supplier industries are concerned, rubber, at least, is likely not to be affected very strongly by the strike because they™re in a period of recovery from their own strike and are 
building inventories and would be operating at virtually full capacity under any circumstances at 
the present time.   
To be specific about how long the strike may be 
before it really has a significant effect, our estimate is that certainly a one-month strike woul
d hardly be felt because 
the first two weeks are 
at the end of this quarter and rather minimal.  The last two week
s of the strike would be in the fourth quarter and would be offset by activity in the remainder of
 the quarter.  We would think 
that something beyond six weeks would be
gin to have a significant effect. MR. BALLES.  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Now, I think that perhaps the time has come to introduce a strong 
optimistic note into our deliberations, and since 
no one else is supplying it, I™d like to comment on the economy as I see it.   We were concerned for a time about sluggishness
 in retail trade.  We™ve learned that 
figures for earlier months had been underestimate
d.  In August, if our statistics can be believed, we had a very strong rise, an increase of well over 2 percent, and more sign
ificant, the increase was widespread.  General merchandise sale
s rose by well over 3 percent; furniture and 
appliances by 3 percent; apparel, after rising sharply in July, rose a little under 1 percent; and so on.  And the reports for the month of Se
ptember so far are quite favorable.   
As for business capital spending, I see rapid increases in the making in view of reports on 
new orders for business capital goods, on construction contracts for commercial and industrial 
buildings, and on new capital appropriations for manufacturing firms.  The picture on housing 
could be better, of course, but there is a slow upward trend, and the figures for August for starts and permits are, I think, clearly reassuring.   
On the inventory side, I think businessmen ar
e behaving in a cautious and admirable way.  
They™re monitoring their inventories and recentl
y, retailers, wholesalers have adjusted their 
inventories significantly.  There are no excesses 
of any significance that I™m aware of, and the expansion is proceeding in 
quite orderly fashion.   
Now, the reports on activity are reasonably satisfactory.  The indus
trial production index for July has been revised upward; for August it™s the same as for July.  In view of our recent 
record over the past year in estimating i
ndustrial production, the chances are that we™re continuing to underestimate industrial production.   
The report on employment in the more reliabl
e establishment series was quite favorable.  
As for the flow of incomes, you read reports about the retardation in the month of August in personal income.  Well, in the first place, you had 
a very sharp rise in July, reflecting Social 
9/21/76 - 18 - 
 Security benefits.  And secondly, the report is for total personal income, a
nd the significant part is nonfarm personal income because the farm compone
nt is sheer conjecture.  It™s an artificial 
figure.  And [nonfarm personal inco
me] shows a rate of increase 
of 8 percent rather than the 5 percent which has been so widely reported in the press.   As far as business income--specifically, corpor
ate profits--is concerned, well, there again, I don™t think the reports in the press are very revealing.  You lump a lot of things into these reports, including profits of the Federal Reserve--which have been quite sluggish, and we don™t regret that.  But domestic indus
tries are doing quite well.  And look at manufacturing, the critical 
industry of the economy.  Look at the evolution of
 profits [after] allowing for inventory valuation adjustment.  Starting with the second quart
er of ™75, $43 billion annual rate, $57 billion, 
$55 billion, $61 billion, $66 billion.  Now, between the first and second quarters you have a 5.2 [percent] increase on a base of 61, which is an enormous increase.   
Now, the picture looks very healthy to me, [but
] I have been skeptical on the inflation side.  I™ve been skeptical about our staff projections.  Our staff has stuck with a figure of 5 to 
5-1/2 percent, and I™ve stuck with a figure of 6 to 7 percent, and I continue to think that our staff is underestimating what is likel
y to happen on the price front. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, you have made 
me feel better al
ready.  There™s one observation I™d like to make about 
this long list of favorable factors.  I™m not sure how favorably 
we ought to interpret the good indications of a coming upturn in
 capital spending, and perhaps the staff has some input on this.   
What I have in mind is that I keep hearing, 
again from our director
s in industry, that a substantial fraction of this increase in capital spending is not productive in the old fashioned sense in that it™s aimed at complying with e
nvironmental requirements.
  Whether it™s the 
scrubbers for the utilities or whether it™s cleaning up the pulp in paper mills, they are spending 
tremendous sums of money to comply with envi
ronmental requirements.  Now this will mean 
dollars pumped into the economy, but it might not mean
 the usual increases in potential for a rise in output per man-hour that we™ve se
en associated in the past with the rise in capital spending. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you™re quite right.  As far as the effect on production, employment, and the short run is concerne
d, it™s immaterial whether you spend money to 
improve your technology or spend money to build 
new plant for environmental or safety reasons.  
But the effects on productivity are very different for the two.  Now, we do have figures on that, and there is enormous variati
on among industries on that.  Do you have the figures in mind, the 
proportion of total capital expenditure that is accounted for by so-called antipollution or safety requirements? 
MR. ZEISEL.  In very general magnitudes,
 it tends to be extremely high in basic-
commodity-producing industries. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Pape
r, steel, very high-- MR. ZEISEL.  About 20 percent in those. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s exactly the figure I had in mind, around 20 percent. 
9/21/76 - 19 - 
 MR. ZEISEL.  For all the industries as a whole, I think it™s closer to 5, in that general magnitude, if I remember correctly. 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I share your assessment on the outlook in capital 
expenditures, but more observation might be helpful. 
 In talking to our directors, we have a great deal of trouble convincing them that this is 
coming because they don™t se
e it in place.  And I 
think the basic difference is they don™t see the plants yet, and the thing we™re looking at are the leading indicators, which suggest they will be fort
hcoming.  So any survey of businessmen as to 
what they see, I think, will reflect what our directors see rather than the point you expressed.  We 
can™t seem to get that difference across to our directors. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, it™s always been that way.  Businessmen have always lagged 
in their recognition.  You know, I don™t hold out very much prai
se for the performance of 
economists, but economists have a far better r
ecord in recognizing changes than businessmen, 
and businessmen have a far better record in reco
gnizing changes than does the consuming public.  
There are these lags in perception that have 
been characteristic for a very many years. 
MR. BLACK.  We have the same problem 
on the matter of wage settlements.  We 
discovered that our directors really think of increases in productivity as 
implying that the average 
worker is working harder, and they don™t see this
, and they don™t realize that you can [get] gains 
in productivity from a larger inpu
t in capital goods.  So your survey, as you suggested, is likely to suggest more inflation.  In fact, we really-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think businessmen will exaggerate just as they think economists 
are likely to understate.  But you know, to come b
ack for a moment to the Ford strike, at the 
present time what concerns me most about the Ford
 strike is the possibility of a whopping wage settlement rather than the effects on econom
ic activity.  Yes, Mr. Coldwell, please. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I didn™t put 
my rose-colored glasses on, but I don™t have a whole lot of problem with
 some of your comment about the future.  I guess my principal 
problem is timing more than perspective on the di
rection of the economy.  I™v
e been doing a little bit of traveling around in the past couple of weeks, and I don™t find a tone of expectation [in] which businessmen and others ar
e looking for the kind of movement
 that you™re talking about.  I recognize the lag which most businessmen have. 
 [Unintelligible] statistical items that you 
mentioned with the exception of unemployment. 
 It certainly seems to portray a stronger 
economy in the future.  And I guess the question 
is, How long do we have to wait for this happy future to come about? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You know, part of the problem is statis
tical reporting in our press and even on the part of our staffs.  Now you take what I™ve said about corporate profits and what I™ve said about personal income--I dug it out for myse
lf, you see.  Our staffs continue to think in terms of broad aggregates, and they do not disagg
regate sufficiently.  Well, that™s the tendency, I 
think, of economists.   
You know, 40 years [ago], if you wanted to 
judge the economy, you had to dig down into details because aggregates were not available.  Now statistici
ans manufacture figures, and we 
look at the aggregates, and, well, I do that myself. 
 I rarely look to disaggregate, but I did a little 9/21/76 - 20 - 
 more preparing for this meeting than I norma
lly do.  We look at aggregates and they don™t 
always tell the story.   A profit picture looks very different if you look at aggregates than if you break the figures down and take out--well, look, you know perfectly well that profits of the Federal Reserve shouldn™t be looked at.  You know perfectly well that profits of our banking firms are down, you 
see.  Take that out.  Profits from outside activit
ies, well, that has a bearing.  But the domestic 
economy, and then you take the most significant 
part, which is manufacturing, moreover, the 
profits of manufacturing--I didn™t go into that; [prof
its] have been concentrated [there].  That is, 
the great improvement has been in the durable goods 
sector.  And I think that is quite significant.  And in the nondurable goods sector, the profits recently have been flat, reflecting the flat activity in that sector of the economy.   
And I think what we read in our newspapers
 about the economy is inadequate.  Based on global figures.  Anyone else like to speak on the economy?  Well, if not, Mr. Broida informs me 
that coffee is ready for us, and we
™ll have to take a short break. [Coffee break] MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Axilrod.  Any questions to Mr. Axilrod?  If 
not--oh yes, Governor Wallich. MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, I was interested
 in the comment on the slowing in growth 
of velocity.  This is a particularly good test becau
se interest rates have been relatively stable.  Do 
you see the prospective ability of velocity to increase as interest rates rise [as being] more limited 
than it would have been last year? MR. AXILROD.  We would expect 
that this 2 percent figure is lower than we are going to have in the future.  We would expect that, as 
economic activity picks up, interest rates will rise, 
and people will economize more on money, and velo
city will increase.  And we™re projecting 
[that] an increase in velocity through mid-1977 in 
V1 [velocity of M1] will be on the order of 
4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent--which is somewhat more 
rapid than in the second year of expansion in most of the previous cycles. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions?  Yes, Mr. Winn. 

MR. WINN.  When you look back
 over history you can almo
st prove anything you want, but [what] you™re struck [by] in the last five years, except for ™72, is the first half™s behavior versus the second.  But bear in mind, most of th
ese dates--you go back and look at the estimates, 
and we start out the month, estimates are high, and 
we tail off each time.  Is there a feeling that 
that™s going to change? MR. AXILROD.  Start out the month? 

MR. WINN.  You know, if we go back to the mi
ddle of the previous month and look at our 
estimates of what™s going to
 happen in the next month. 9/21/76 - 21 - 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Of what variable? 
MR. WINN.
  Well, of M1. 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, I don™t, I™m not aware 
of successive lowerings of rates.  My 
memory of it is that we miss on one side and 
we miss on the other side but I™m not aware of a 
steady-- 
MR. WINN.  In the second half? 

MR. AXILROD.  Second half of the calendar, you mean?  Oh, well, that™s right.  We have 
examined our seasonals back and forth over se
veral years, and that persists and so-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Wait, wait, I™m 
not following this.  What persists? MR. AXILROD.  Well, I think President Winn 
is referring to the second half of the calendar year having a slower growth rate, and we have not been able to find that our seasonal factors are causing that result.  We have exam
ined it several times with the help of academic 
experts and run many different seasonal adjust
ment programs--30 was th
e last count--of which we made 10 available to the Committee, and virtually
 all come in with that result.  So something 
else is causing that, like policy change
s coincidentally around that period. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I haven™t been aware of that.  I™d like to look into that with you, Mr. Axilrod.  I didn™t know about this repetitive intra-year fluctuation.  Any comment on Mr. Winn™s problem or any other?  Mr. Baughman. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  To Mr. Axilrod.  Would you f
eel any better in the current situation if you saw a little more evidence of price flex
ibility on savings and small CD accounts? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, I don™t know that I™d feel
 particularly better, President Baughman.  
I believe that if inflows persist at this rate 
into those institutions and if loan demand [remains 
weak]--the thrift institutions have fairly high mortgage demand, but at banks, loan demands 
remain weak--and inflows persist very strong, I be
lieve they will have to be under considerable 
pressure either to adjust their advertising or
 their rates because th
ey are not going to get sufficient yield.  That would imply some downdrift 
in Treasury yields, and they will be rather unprotected in terms of earnings.  I believe that
™s the economics of it.  But in terms of other 
factors, I have no comment. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We want to thank Mr. Baughman and Mr. Axilrod.  If there aren™t 
any further questions, let™s turn to our deliberation on monetary pol
icy.  In the interest of giving the members of the Committee a target to shoot
 at, by way of either favorable comment or 
complete demolition, let me suggest some polic
y miracle targets for the September-October 
period.   I am inclined to think that, [with] the econom
y behaving as it has; the economic prospects 
being what they appear to be; the monetary aggr
egates behaving like they have; interest rates, most important of all, adjusting downward
--I think in good measure because of increasing 
confidence and the fact that we have been standing still on the federal funds rate, I am inclined to 
9/21/76 - 22 - 
 think we ought to remain pretty much where we 
are for the next month, and I would suggest that 
we set a target range of 4 to 8 for M1, of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 for M2, and stay pretty much where we 
are with the federal funds rate.  Who™
d like to speak first?  Mr. Coldwell. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I don™t ha
ve a whole lot of problems in the  
[unintelligible] question.  I guess my principal question is one of 
flexibility.  I like to cover my 
bets, frankly, and that to me means we permit mo
re flexibility in our approach to this matter 
rather than the kind of rigidity in funds rate approach that we have had.  I don™t have problems 
with the range you suggested on the monetary aggr
egates, I think [unintelligible] range of 4-1/2 
to 5-1/2-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m sorry, I think I miss
poke on monetary.  I have various jottings 
and I looked at the wrong one.  Let me repeat the 
ranges that I had in mind: 4 to 8 for M1, and 8 
to 12 for M2.  I think I said 7-1/2 to 11-1/2; that was last month™
s target range.  I™m sorry, Phil. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Well, it was a 1/2 point [uni
ntelligible] I didn™t read you that closely.  What I™m really aiming toward is letting the mark
et have a little more freedom to move [within] 
the interest rate picture.  If the market believed, in its wis
dom, that a slightly lower funds rate 
could be accommodated, then I™m perfectly willing to accommodate it, provided our aggregates 

are moving within the bands set.  If the bands
 were 4 to 8 for M1; 8 to 12,I don™t care, 
somewhere in that neighborhood, for M2--I™ve give
n you a suggested alternative which tries to portray this flexibility that 
I™m trying to allow here.   
And I think the flexibility could go either way if [the aggregates] show any kind of marked 
movement.  But I think it would require that we
 look with a little more 
grace upon the idea of the market leading us somewhere, permitting the mark
et to lead up or down within the range of the 
federal funds rate we establish.  It means utilizi
ng the full range for the aggregates before the Desk seeks to guide this federal funds rate, providing the rate™s moving at orderly pace.  I would 
not like to see anything over a 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 [upper bound] for the funds rate before the end of the next period unless we got some pretty violen
t moves in the aggregates.  On the other hand, I wouldn™t much want to see it below 4-1/4 to 4-1/2, certainly if the thing is going violently in the other direction.  I really would rather keep about where we are, with perhaps a little shading toward the soft side if the mark
et thinks that desirable.   I guess my underlying rationale for all of this is
 that I™m just not all that certain, and I™m a 
little bit perturbed about the idea that fiscal policy may come along 
[with] more stimulant 
injections at a time when I think 
we™re fading out [of the] time in 
the cycle when such things are 
appropriate.  So I guess I™m pleading for a little fl
exibility here but basically staying [in] the 
same general frame we™re in. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell.  Mr. Kimbrel, please. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, I think we accep
t the feeling that there may very well be 
a temporary lull--but temporary, really.  And 
we share many of the optimistic observations you 
named earlier.  We would be somewhat reluct
ant to engage in any obvious easing at this particular time, fearful that, with
 everything else, the market could 
misinterpret [it]--that we were 
unduly concerned about the present state and were moving at this 
juncture to accommodate that, 9/21/76 - 23 - 
 [which is] more than we really feel.  With no 
apparent end to the federal deficit--and, like you, my question earlier certainly indicated that I have 
some difficulty with prices over the next five 
to six quarters with over a 5 to 5-1/2 percent increase.   I guess that if we could maintain something 
of a steady posture, I have the feeling that 
businessmen themselves would be encouraged 
to make some forward commitment.  Though I, 
too, would favor [remaining] very close to exactl
y where we are at the present time, I do feel 
some concern, that if we stay at this specific sp
ot very long, particularly with interest rates and 
federal funds rates, that when we do move, there is going to be an overreactive reading of our move at that time.  So I would hope that we ma
intain a steady posture but not unreasonably long.   I guess I should not pass this way without hoping that, some time--and not too far away--it 
would be convenient to consider some adjustme
nt in reserve requirements.  Announcing maybe 
that this is not intended as an
 easing move but with idea of encouraging bankers to not give difficult lending terms and to consider some [uni
ntelligible] more aggressive practices and, not the least, to reduce inequ
ities with nonmember banks. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimb
rel.  Mr. Eastburn now, please. MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, I would be ha
ppy with prescriptions appropriate in the current situation of the [unintellig
ible] be able to see the funds rate maintained about right where 
it is.  I do think that we are confronting an issue in the future where we are going to have to have more flexibility.  I think in a longer-run proposition we should be using the aggregates directive rather than the money market directive, and I 
would hope that we could come to address this 
issue in a special session as soon as it could be worked out. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Black, may we hear from you? 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I find myself 
in somewhat of a dilemma on the policy 
question today.  I come out almost precisely 
where you do.  The healthy economic trend seems 
to be in prospect, and I think we made definite
 headway [unintelligible] with the twin problems 
of inflation and inflationary expectations.  At the same time, afte
r a year and a half of recovery, we™ve got substantial unused resources, [with] the unemployment rate moving in the wrong 
direction for three successive months.  This bei
ng the case, I certainly welcome the recent action 
on the prime rate, and I would like to see mortga
ge rates come down more than they have.   
But at the same time I am quite concerned ove
r this rapid expansion in the savings deposits at banks and other financial institutions.  I believe M2 has been growing much too rapidly lately, and I certainly [do not] want to risk any furthe
r acceleration of this by pushing down the federal funds rate.  And I think we ought to bear in mind 
that there have been a number of institutional 
changes recently that have made the savings de
posits more like time deposits.  I would suggest 
that we begin to weight M2 a little more heavily than M1 instead of weighting [them] exactly the same, as we have done in the past.   
At the same time, I wouldn™t want to raise 
the federal funds rate now, and I couldn™t go along with the wording of alternative C, although I do like the specifications for M2 that are embodied in alternative C, so I come out about 
where most of the others had in holding the 
money market conditions about where they are.  
And I think the 5 to 5-1/2 [percent federal funds 9/21/76 - 24 - 
 rate] as specified would be about right, although I confess to having a bias in favor of a wider range and more flexibility.  But for the time being, I would be prepared to endorse the money 

market directive.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Jackson. 
MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I feel that it 
is appropriate to maintain about our same 
posture.  I do think that in view of the announcements expected this week, we may get a market 
reaction on the reverse side. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean the 
announcement concerning money growth? 
MR. JACKSON.  Right.  And to that extent I think we may 
get a slight change between our posture and the market™s posture, which may ta
ke a little while to work out.  For that reason, 
I would be inclined to favor the narrow rather than the broader approach to the federal funds rate and a money market directive.  And I do think, in 
view of the strong growth in savings, that in the first part of September, the 9 to 13 range is
 probably the more likely consequence of this type of interest rate posture that we have, although I don™t know that I feel we need argue about 8 to 12 or 9 to 13 percent.  The consequences of [unintelligible] worth arguing about, but I think those are possibly the likely consequences. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Who would like to speak now?  Yes, 
Mr. MacLaury. 
MR. MACLAURY.  First of all, Mr. Chairman, 
could I get a clarification of your proposal on the funds rate range?  I™m confused as to whet
her you™re speaking of a 4-3/4 to 5-3/4 range as proposed in the Bluebook or 5 to 5-1/2 as was mentioned by someone else here.  I think they™re 
both centered on the 5-1/4, but I™m not sure wh
ich you were proposing in terms of the width. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I spoke a little va
guely on that.  I would prefer the present range. MR. MACLAURY.  The narrower range. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The narrower one, yes. MR. MACLAURY.  Well, in that 
context, if I may carry on.  I certainly agree with your optimism about the economic outlook.  I guess I am
 closer to the staff on its inflation outlook, and we will see where that comes out next year
.  The M ranges that you proposed are fine, I 
think.  If I understood Phil™s sugge
stion, I would not wish to disregard the whole range of 4 to 8 on the Ms or whatever else is consistent and let the funds rate in effect be led by the market.  I 
think we have more or less agreed to a system of operation of linking movements of the 

aggregates to our funds rate, and until we have this debate that I also hope we have soon on our procedures, that we would not change that mark
edly.  On the funds range, in the meantime, I 
think that my feeling is that we are in a less 
sensitive position and that we ought to, in my view, 
go back to a wider range of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, centered on the 5-1/4. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. MacLaury.  Mr. Balles now, please. 9/21/76 - 25 - 
 MR. BALLES.  I™m sorry, Mr. Chairman, did you call on me? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, please. 

MR. BALLES.  The noise outside--I couldn™t hear.  Well, I think at a time like this, while I 
share the hopes of the economy coming up out of
 this lull, and without wanting to be a Cassandra, I guess I™m a little more dubious than some
 around the table as to when we™ll see this renewed strength.  And where this comes out on the bot
tom line is sort of a visceral feeling about 
it--if anything, err on the side of ease.   The markets have been softening in terms of inte
rest rates.  I was glad to see this latest 
decline in the prime rate.  I think in view of what 
I consider to be a little bit of uncertainty in the 
outlook, including, among other things, how long this 
auto strike will last 
and a few other things, 
I would be tempted to follow the strategy now, [giv
en] the uncertainties around the real sector of the economy, to aim for a steady hand on the growth of the aggregates.  As opposed to the 

situation earlier this year, when, because of the changing demand function for money, the 
disturbances seemed to be in the financial s
ector, it was more appropria
te to call for a steady 
hand on interest rates.  I think perhaps the reverse may be true now.   
So, net net, I could accept the specifications on M1 and M2 that you mentioned, but if 
anything, I would like to see, irrespective of what range we set for the federal funds rate--whether it™s 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, which would be my preference, or whether it™s 5 to 5-1/2, both 
centered on 5-1/4--a willingness of the Desk to lean in the direction of letting that rate move down a bit in order to make sure that we conti
nue to get the minimum growth in M1 that we™ve 
targeted. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. Wallich now. 

MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, we™ve had a remarkable degree of stability both in 
interest rates and rate of growth in the aggregates.  And that tempts one to want to perpetuate it.  
The easiest way of doing that is fixing a narrow funds range, but I think we would do that at some cost.  Later, things may change.  By th
at time the market may 
have thought that when things are good then everything is very stable.  We ought to keep the market accustomed to some 
degree of variability.  For that reason I would go with a wider funds rate.  I think 4-3/4 [to] 5-3/4 would be right.   The aggregates as you specified them, I think, are good.  It™s probably desirable to put a slightly lower ceiling on the expans
ion of M2 before there is a reaction in the funds rate because M2 is now moving at a rate substantially faster than M1.  The gap is unusual, and even though this may mean mostly a negation and not really 
the creation of additional liquidity, nevertheless it™s a little excessive, and so I would agree with you on 8 to 12 as a substitute for 9 to 13. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.
  Mr. Mayo, may we hear from you? 
MR. MAYO.  I agree, too, Mr. Chairman, on the 
wider federal funds range--4-3/4 to 5-3/4 I think is quite appropriate and it doesn™t box us in quite as much
 as the 5 to 5-1/2 would seem 
to, at least in the public gaze.  I 
don™t see any real difference in th
e effect of one versus the other 
on the way the Manager would operate, but he may wish to comment on that.   
9/21/76 - 26 - 
 As far as M1 is concerned, 4 to 8 is fine.  I had initially written down on my note sheet, Mr. Chairman, 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 
on M2, which was the figure that you started with and then changed to 8 to 12.  I certainly have no reason to differ from the 8 to 12.  I share the point, 
though, that Governor Wallich made on our M2 range
.  I do feel fairly strongly that it shouldn™t be as high as 9 to 13.   On the reserve requirement point, in case all the members of the [Federal Reserve] Board 
aren™t familiar with it, the Conference of Presid
ents meeting in Chicago last week adopted a 
recommendation to the Board with regard to rese
rve requirements.  It went along the lines that 
we could see merit in some announced plan late th
is year, perhaps the last six or seven weeks of the year, as to our intention to reduce reserve requirements, perhaps over some sort of a 
scheduled plan starting with some reduction be
fore the end of calendar 1976.  Seasonally, even though the seasonal may not be very great this year
, there still would be some reason to provide 
reserves in this way.  And, indeed, we feel further steps could be taken, even when the seasonal is more neutral, because of our ability to o
ffset the effects in open market transactions. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Volcker now, please. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  My
 substantial feelings about the situation have been pretty well expressed by Mr. Balles, I think, and his repeated allusion to erring on the side of ease, if we make any change at 
all.  I don™t feel any strong need for changing interest rates, and the kind of bands that you proposed for the aggregates are all right with me.   My concern--to express it opposite, I guess, to the way Mr. Balles did--would be increasing the federal funds rate very readily, and that™s what bothers me about a range of the 
federal funds rate from 4-3/4 to 5-3/4.  I re
ally don™t look at moving down in the same way I would look at moving up at this stage of the 
game, given the degree of sluggishness there has been in the economy.  How to handle that probl
em within the framework of the mode of 
operation that we have isn™t quite clear to me.  
I™m inclined to say we ought to have a range of 
4-3/4 to 5-1/2 without moving the rate right now--not moving it at all unless we began moving 
outside these aggregate ranges.  But whether that kind of asymmetrical approach makes sense to 
other people--[it™s] not quite rational, I don™t think, but it expresses my feeling about where we 
should be with the aggregates. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We haven™t done this frequently.  We™ve done it before, and I don™t think--it may or may not be desirable
--but I don™t see any irrationality in it. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I will leave that as a rational proposal and I-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Everything you say, Paul, by the nature of things, is rational. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I™m not sure about that. 
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I intended to pur
sue with Alan on the question, would he operate any differently [unintelligible] 5 to 5-1/2 versus 4-3/4 to 5-3/4? 
MR. HOLMES.  Not unless instructed by the Committee to [move] very rapidly if the 
aggregates were moving to either end of the ra
nge.  But you would move further with that range 
9/21/76 - 27 - 
 if the aggregates were moving either way.  Unless the Committee wants a different set of 
instructions. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you Mr. Volcker, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Gardner now. 
MR. GARDNER.  I think Paul has rationality and merit in his asymmetrical approach to 
the funds rate.  I am, perhaps from my antecedents
, very impressed with the curious behavior of 
bank lending in this period of recovery.  You™ve got a sharp divergence, and not only that, but we™re in a season now where bank lending should pick up, and we don™t have any evidence of it picking up.  And the economic analysis that we™ve 
had today, I generally concur with it.  But a slight slowing in the recovery process or at least more modera
te economic growth leads me to 
think that we should, in due course, perhaps 
at future meetings, consider looking at the 
aggregates as President Eastburn has suggested, instead of a money ma
rket directive.   And I™d like to comment on the proposals th
at Bob Mayo made and, I guess, Ernie or 
Willis.  You know the bank reserve picture is such 
that it seems to me we would want to defer 
looking at changes in bank reserves and pressure on the banks--far from it.  Banks have very, 
very weak and placid loan demands, 
and this is a curious fact, with all the other elements in the 
economy proceeding to the tune of a different
 drum, I guess.  Even the commercial paper 
market--if you put that together with bank lending, 
it doesn™t impress me as being characteristic 
of the season or the period of a recovery.   I think, therefore, that I can associate myself very clearly with alternative B and those 
ranges.  I would also opt for the bulge in the lo
wer end [of the federal funds rate] as Paul has suggested, and I would also urge you to put the reserve question aside at this meeting. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s not a matte
r for this Committee to act on, [not] in the 
power of the Committee.  I suspect that the Bank 
Presidents who are speaking on this issue have in mind the [Federal Reserve System] membership problem at least as much as the problem of 

monetary policy. MR. MACLAURY.  Exactly.  Very much so.  Much more so. 
MR. BALLES.  Yes, that is our emphasis, Mr. Chairman, and we feel that this is one of the 
few areas where there is any discretion left on the part of the Federal Reserve System without 
legislative changes. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that what
 our Bank Presidents have to say on the subject, and they™re close to the 
firing line--closer certainly than
 we are at the Board--deserves 
respect on the part of the Board and will receive it. 
SPEAKER(?).  Could I ask a question?  Did I 
understand you, Steve, to be agreeing to Governor Coldwell™s proposition? 
MR. GARDNER.  I don™t know whether I want to state the case quite as specifically as Phil has.  I sort of like the language in both the single aggregate proposal [unintelligible] alternative B.  The market is proceeding pretty well. 
9/21/76 - 28 - 
 SPEAKER(?).  When you talk about 
Paul™s proposal, what do you mean? 
MR. GARDNER.  Paul™s was his federal funds rate proposal. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think th
at what Mr. Gardner was seeking to convey is general acceptance of the range and the asymmetry that
 Mr. Volcker had suggested.  That was my 
interpretation.  Is that correct? 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™m not sure I 
fully appreciate all the implications of 
what Governor Coldwell was saying.  At times he 
seemed to be saying thi
ngs that I agreed with, and at times he seemed symmetri
cal and certainly with larger federal funds movements in fact 
than I think we want to see at this point. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right,
 who would like to speak next, please.  Yes, Mr. Morris. MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to 
support the asymmetrical funds range here.  I think the evidence does suggest that we are 
getting a reacceleration in the economy,  but it 
seems to me it would be prudent to give the Manage
r a little more room to lower the funds rate in 
the event that the evidence coming in tends to su
ggest that this reacceleration is in fact not 
occurring.  But with the understanding that he would not move to the midpoint of this 
asymmetric range but could use it
 in the event that the aggregates come in weaker than were 
expected. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Anyone else?  Mr. Baughman. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, just to e
xpress the view that I agree with the 
suggestions that it might be appropriate to see a 
little more flexibility 
of our operation.  I would 
hope that it would tend to reduce the indication that we™re supporting those elements in the 
markets which are resisting the tendency for rate
s to move down.  It seems to me that the 
situation is one which would l
ook better if we saw a little mo
re downward flexibility in the 
private part of this market currently.   
It seems to me also that within our frame 
of operation, the best way to get a little more 
flexibility is to go the route of 
the aggregate directive.  I guess 
that™s not necessary, but as we operate, it seems to me even more like [unintelligible
].  As to the specific  figures given, I have no objection. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Who would like to speak next?  Who 
having already spoken would like to speak again? MR. BLACK.  That™s a dangerous precedent, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Wallich. 

MR. WALLICH.  I just want to
 say I think the asymmetry proposal with the instruction to stay near the present level unless there are extreme movements is a good one. 
MR. MAYO.  I would agree with that. 9/21/76 - 29 - 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, I want to ma
ke a proposal as follows.  Now (1) that we adopt the aggregates directive; (2) that we adopt an M1 target range of 4 to 8; an M2 range of 8 to 12; and a federal funds rate range of 4-3/4 
to 5-1/2 with the understanding that the Desk will 
operate on an asymmetrical principle.  As far 
as I can judge, that comes close to expressing a 
broad consensus of the Committee. 
MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I didn™t catch that
 final key phrase, where you said with the 
understanding that the Desk would what? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Would observe the asymme
trical principle as previously described by Mr. Volcker. MR. BALLES.  Fine. 
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I™m not sure I 
understand the reason for moving back to the 
aggregates directive as against money market. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there are two reasons in my ow
n mind.  One is, I don™t like 
to see us repeating in successive meetings a money market 
directive.  The Committee had 
reached a decision to proceed normally on a monetary
 aggregate directive.  
I don™t want to see us drift into [regular use of a m
oney market directive].  Now the 
Committee, as it reconsiders its 
policy, may possibly prefer a money market directive as a broad rule.  I doubt if the Committee 

will reach that decision.  I would oppos
e it.  It™s possible, but if we
 do it, let™s do it deliberately and not drift into it, so that is one reason for my suggestion.   
Another reason is that we™re broadening the federal funds rate range a little, and that too, I think, justifies a shift to a monetary aggregate directive.  But 
all this is at the pleasure of the Committee.  Now I think that Governor Coldwell
™s suggestion deserves an explicit vote, and members of the Committee who are inclined to 
support Governor Coldwell™s suggestion on the directive would kindly indicate that. MR. BLACK.  Could we have that read? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The dire
ctive would read as follows:  ﬁThe Committee seeks a 
reasonably accommodative posture regarding bank reserve and money ma
rket conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing within the bands of expectation.ﬂ  Well,
 there is no general support for that directive, as far as I can judge.   I think what is perhaps most uncertain about my suggestion or vote is
 what I™ve said about the federal funds rate.  And let™s have a show 
of hands on the part of members of the Committee 
whether my suggestion, first, that the range be 
4-3/4 to 5-1/2, and second, that the asymmetrical 
principle be expected by the Desk, whether that suggestion is generally acceptable.  Let™s have a 
show of hands. MR. BROIDA.  Ten, Mr. Chairman.  It™s unanimous. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, do we want more 
discussion before the vote?  Mr. Black.  
9/21/76 - 30 - 
 MR. BLACK.  Is there an understanding that we would weigh M1 and M2 on an equal basis? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, I did not say that, and that is the principle on which we™ve proceeded in recent meetings, a
nd I have tacitly assumed that, 
but that should be explicit. 
MR. BLACK.  Well, I can foresee a case wher
e M1 might not grow very rapidly, which 
might lead you to lower the federal funds rate, an
d at the same time M2 might be growing quite 
rapidly. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, then, one would offset the other if that happened. MR. BLACK.  I guess that my feelings about 
M2 having grown too rapidly, I [would] feel a little concerned about moving down [just] because M1 didn™t come in a little more. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What would you suggest, that we give more weight to M2? 
MR. BLACK.  That™s my feeling, but there doesn™t seem to be any feeling on the part of 
others that M2 ought to be weighted a little more heavily. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Would the Committee be 
inclined to give M2 a larger weight? 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there does not seem to be any broad sentiment in favor of 
that, so we™ll stay with the general principle of giving approximately equal weight, with 
emphasis on ﬁapproximatelyﬂ as well as ﬁequal.ﬂ 
MR. COLDWELL.  May I have just a bit 
of clarification, Mr. Chairman, on this 
asymmetric principle?  If I understand, what the 
Desk would do is stay at 5-1/4 unless things start moving toward the upper or lower parts of th
eir bands.  And all this asymmetrical principle 
does is hold the wider range on the bottom si
de within which the Desk may operate. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Pretty much, pretty much. 

MR. HOLMES.  That™s the way I would interpret it. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  If there are no additional comments or questions, and apparently 
that is our situation now, let™s vote, and would you be good enough to call the role. MR. BROIDA.   
Chairman Burns  Yes 

Vice Chairman Volcker  Yes 

Mr. Balles   Yes 

Mr. Black   Yes 

Mr. Coldwell  Yes 

Mr. Gardner   Yes 

Mr. Jackson  Yes 
9/21/76 - 31 - 
 Mr. Kimbrel  Yes 
Mr. Lilly  Yes 

Mr. Wallich   Yes 

Mr. Winn  Yes 
It™s unanimous, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, we have a Partee and a Holmes-Axilrod memorandum.  
And Mr. Axilrod, would you be good enough to summarize the results of your deliberation--you might want to call it a study.  And th
en your recommendation to the Committee. 
MR. AXILROD.  Essentially, Mr. Chairman, we 
considered four problems with regard to 
the instant reporting of Desk transactions through Telerate.  Remembering, of course, that 
Telerate is not the only mechanisms at work in
 the market--the Dow-Jones wire [gives] reports 
[of] transactions--it™s simply that Telerate reports them more
 promptly and, of course, often 
before they™re consummated.  I mean, they report 
when the Desk enters the market.  On analysis, 
we determined that there was no way-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Excuse me.  Pl
ease continue--I™m familiar with your 
memorandum.  I have some notes on it, but I don™
t seem to have a copy.  Ignore my absence. 
MR. AXILROD.  We did not believe that th
ere was any effective way that the Desk 
transactions could be kept secret, so to speak, 
for the reasons outlined in the memorandum.  So 
we believe that we have to live with the publicity under current circumstances.   
Secondly, we considered whether that publicity in any way made the FOMC™s 
posture--that minutes, the policy record, shoul
d not be released except with a 35-day lag--whether it made that posture untenable.  
We concluded that it did not because what the 
Telerate system is telling the market is what our
 objective is now, or permitting the market to 
infer what our objective is now, today, for the federal funds rate, whereas the policy record gives rather more revealing information, [which is] wh
at our objective might li
kely be two or three weeks from now.  And if you™re going to make m
oney, that™s where the money is to be made, in 
forecasting where the Fed™s going to be in the future
.  Of course, that™s where the most risk is 
also, but that is the informati
on that market sophisticates, peopl
e with financial resources, can use to greatest advantage.  That is also the type of information that would most complicate our 
operations.   So, from two points of view, it does not seem to
 us that there™s any argument that can be 
made to release the policy reco
rd immediately after the Committ
ee meeting, to release the specs 
immediately after the Committee meeting.  So we 
don™t believe the Telerate system invalidates 
the current Committee™s argument to pr
eserve the specs for 35 days.   We also considered two other possibilities, given the fact that we didn™t believe that secrecy could be preserved.  And one was, could somewhat more fluctuation in the federal funds 
rate be permitted within a day or within a wee
k.  We were not addressing ourselves to the width of the range but simply the quest
ion of widening the intervention points so that the market would 
have a more difficult time in gauging where the 
Desk is and thus would have a more difficult 
time in gauging changes in the Desk™s own objectiv
es.  On balance, we felt there was little 9/21/76 - 32 - 
 advantage to that, that the mark
et would simply look at wider in
tervention points and that the federal funds rate itself might 
move more promptly to these wi
der intervention points once the dealers in federal funds began to learn the met
hod of the Desk operation.  So we did not think, on balance, that that would reduce market se
nsitivity to changes 
in our operations.   Secondly, we considered whether it might not be desirable 
to publish information at the 
end of the day on Desk transactions, that is, the amount the Desk did in a particular area, and no other information.  This way, everyone would be on the same footing.  On balance, we believe 
that there, too, the disadvantage
s would outweigh the advantages.  It might give rise to a number 
of questions that we did not want to publicize at that time with
 regard to the purpose and reason and to a number of misundersta
ndings in the process.   So, in sum, we believe that there are no ch
anges that appear to be required in Desk operations or in Committee procedures, given th
is system.  I think, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. 
Holmes might wish to add a comment or two on 
the specifics from the Desk point of view. 
MR. HOLMES.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I really have
 very little to add to what Steve said.  We do live in a goldfish bowl, unfortunately, but that™s a fact of life.  Tele
rate is not the only mechanism, as Steve said, that transmits informa
tion that we™re in the market.  When we come 
[into the market], in every dealer house, lights 
go on and bells flash, and people or salesmen are 
on the phone to their customers.  So this is some
thing we have to live with.  Telerate perhaps reaches a slightly larger audience.  They™ve 
been quite accurate in
 reporting our individual 
operations.  They can give no information when
 we™re operating for the System account or on 
how much we™re doing, because the st
reet never really knows that.   
On balance, it seems to me that, while it ma
y be annoying to have everything laid out on a little machine 20 seconds after you go
 into the market, I think it™s 
something that we can afford 
to live with without any serious damage to our operations. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I couldn™t find my notes
, but recollecting as best I can, I had questions.  On page 8, the memorandum reads:  ﬁI
f the Desk simply permitted the funds rate to 
move in, for example, a 1/2 percent band around 
its objective before intervening, rather than a 1/4 percent band, the market would probably behave a little differently.ﬂ  Well, I don™t question 
the judgment--I don™t know enough to question th
e judgment--but it is a judgment, it™s not a 
statement of fact.  What harm would there be
 in the experiment to see, well, so we™re 
[unintelligible].  If it turns differently, there might be an advantage. 
MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, I think Steve and 
I both thought that this is something that 
we expect the Committee to be discussing when th
ey have a special meeting on procedures.  And 
it really oughtn™t get too much mi
xed up in something on the Telerate machine itself, but I think 
it-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, I think that™s fair
.  Well, let™s hold that as a subject for 
discussion.  And another question that occurred to me is, on your page 9 you say, ﬁWhile no 
formal System announcement is now being ma
de on daily Desk operations, the Public Information Department has, upon inquiry, confirme
d reports of Desk activity in the market of 9/21/76 - 33 - 
 the type recorded by Telerate.ﬂ  Well, if you do 
that in response to an inquiry, then you™re supplying an answer to some individuals.  Then 
why not make it public to
 all [unintelligible]? 
MR. HOLMES.  Mr. Chairman, I must say that
 demand for this sort of confirmation of 
what people hear in the street or what they see 
on Telerate has not been very great, and this is a rare occasion that someone will call and say, ﬁAre you buying coupons?ﬂ 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, but if you tell some people what you™re doing, you ought to tell all alike.  That™s the way it struck me upon reading it. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Or you can go the other [way] and say why confirm it at 
all. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, we might-- 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I was surprised to
 hear we did this, as a matter of fact. 
MR. HOLMES.  I see very little harm in doing 
it.  As I say, the demand is not great.  I 
mean, we don™t do this at the Desk. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m not th
inking of harm here, except harm to our public image.  
I™m not thinking of harm to mark
ets, but I would feel very uncomfortable if the statement like 
this were in the public arena and we™d be 
charged so quickly on Capitol Hill with making 
information available to some market participants 
and not to others.  I™m th
inking solely of that.  It™s not a good posture for us to be in, and we
 certainly ought to do the one or the other, I™m 
inclined to think.  You talk to no one, or talk to all of them. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, this does say they respond to news media, which I 
assume means it can be published for all. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s
 a little different, and some ge
t it faster than others.  I feel uncomfortable, I just feel so uncomfortable reading that. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I don™t really know why we do it at all. MR. HOLMES.  I see no harm in changing that policy. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think this, too, ought to be discussed rather fully.  We need 
not--in fact, any decision we reach today woul
d be a hurried decision, and I don™t think we ought 
to decide today, but let™s think about that when we have our special meeting.  Any other 
question?  Those were the two that I recall occurred to me.  Yes, Mr. Eastburn. 
MR. EASTBURN.  May I follow up that point briefly?  I think 
it would be helpful to have a little bit more on costs and benefits of publishing daily what the Desk did. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Daily,  or maybe weekly. 
9/21/76 - 34 - 
 MR. EASTBURN.  All right, or whatever the period is.  If you go on the assumption that 
services of this kind continue, I think maybe rather than trying to
 stop the tide, say that we don™t want to add to concentration on short-term deve
lopments in the present-
-the market would do it 
anyhow.  Then, it seems to me, the thrust turns 
into a question that you raised, Mr. Chairman, 
that is, what is our public posture with respect to information we have. 
MR, GARDNER.  Alan, the way this is written, it says the Desk ﬁhasﬂ--upon inquiry.  I hope you don™t respond to one inquiry and not to another. MR. HOLMES.  Oh no. 

MR, GARDNER.  You really mean ﬁdoes,ﬂ I hope. 

MR. HOLMES.  No, it™s the Public Information 
Department, not the Desk.  We do not talk 
to the press. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, 
that™s exactly the same. 
MR. HOLMES.  But it™s the same-- 

MR.GARDNER.  But the point is, if you get an inquiry, you treat all inquiries the same 
way. MR. HOLMES.  Absolutely. 

MR. WALLICH.  I find very intriguing the sugge
stion that there™d be a full listing of all operations.  Now, the idea is stated here, and then it is rejected, and I wonder how strongly the 
authors feel about this rejection.  I could see that very considerable benefits in terms of public 
posture would come from it--we tell everything.  At
 the same time, we don™t tell very much that 
isn™t on Telerate, as far as I can see. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Wouldn™t we put Telerate out of business? MR. WALLICH.  They have so many othe
r pieces of information, Mr. Chairman-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™m not shedding tears. 

MR. STERNLIGHT.  It™s a timing factor. 

MR. WALLICH.  --exchange rates, which make
s it a very attractive thing to acquire for 
other reasons. MR. AXILROD.  Governor Wallich, the disadvant
age that we saw--it would add one piece 
of information to Telerate; it would give 
the amount, probably.  ﬁThe System today bought 
$200 million of Treasury coupon issuesﬂ peri
od, that™s what we contemplated. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me ask this.  This wa
sn™t clear to me.  When the System buys 
or sells on its own account, we don™t answer that question through the Public Information office, 
and Telerate, they don™t publish it. 9/21/76 - 35 - 
 MR. AXILROD.  They indicate that the System is buying, but they don™t know the 
amount. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  They don™t know--but otherwise they do know the amount. 
MR. AXILROD.  For customer accounts of the Desk, yes. 

MR. HOLMES.  For the customer accounts.  
Mr. Chairman, when we™re operating for the 
System account, we don™t want to announce an amount in advance because part of what we do 

may depend on what sort of res
ponse we get to our operations. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But they do know that we™re operating.  Well now, wait a minute 
now.  They know that we™re operating from the dealers, right? 
MR. HOLMES.  Yes. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And if they know from 
the dealers that we™re in the market, do 
they not also learn from the dealer
s how much we™re buying or selling? 
MR. HOLMES.  Sometimes they make rather a
ccurate guesses, sometimes the guesses are 
very wrong, because not all dealers want to give 
everybody else a list of what they had done with 
the Desk in a given operation. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But the dealers will inva
riably or almost invariably indicate our presence in the market on the buying or selling side. 
MR. HOLMES.  Yes. 

MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, if
 I were the publisher of Penthouse magazine or any other 
mischievous person, and I know that a gadget was 
used by the System, and then I learned from 
an unhappy Telerate salesman or a dealer that 
it was withdrawn as a means of furthering the 
alleged secrecy of what we™re doing--I think we
™re sticking our neck out a mile, if after 
something is in place, we pull back on 
it.  I may see it totally wrong, but I think-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But we ma
y want to go the other way. MR. WINN.  Well, that™s correct.  I think this 
is one of those little cute situations that 
could be magnified to make us look sort of 
bad by someone who wants to make us look bad. 
MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, I was trying to
 respond to Governor Wallich™s question 
of the disadvantages we saw to the proposal of announcing the amounts that we do.  The 

disadvantage we saw, Governor Wallich, was not th
at the announcement itself, per se, would be 
harmful, but that questions would arise in people™s minds.  It ma
y be difficult to stop with the announcement, but we would begin to be
 compelled just to explain why-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t see why. Why would you be co
mpelled?  If you have a 
policy of not explaining, of releasing figures without explanation--as a matter of fact, for years 
9/21/76 - 36 - 
 I™ve been a proponent of statistic
al releases by government that
 carry no explanation because I™ve seen too often that the e
xplanations are self-serving. MR. AXILROD.  I believe, Mr. Chairman, you c
ould hold the line.  There wouldn™t be a problem on that, but then the other risk would 
be, you would get considerable misinterpretation 
of your motives in the market afterwards. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there™
s no shortage of that now. MR. WALLICH.  I think it would be a very ni
ce posture to be able to say we publish all 
we do in the market every day, and then there 
remains only one little bi
t that we don™t publish, which is where we want to be at the end of
 the market by our decision [unintelligible]. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh no, we have daily figures on the money supply we don™t publish.  If you were to build a publication route, I™d want to have this--the staff, first, and then 
this Committee, consider very carefully whet
her we publish daily information or, let us say, 
weekly information. 
MR. AXILROD.  The Committee does understa
nd, Mr. Chairman, that we do publish 
weekly. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Because, after all, you know-- 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
  We publish weekly. MR. AXILROD.  We do publish weekly
 through our [unintelligible]. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Overall. 

MR. AXILROD.  Right, the net change during the week is discernable. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s correct. 

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I 
must say, Mr. Chairman, I find their argument in this 
particular point somewhat more persuasive th
an you do.  Maybe I™m more conscious of the 
frailties of human beings in responding to th
e pressures that I suspect would arise.   But I mainly wanted to say, I found these 
couple of paragraphs that you referred to, beginning at the bottom of 7 and 8 and going to the 
top of 9, interesting and to the point in the 
light of discussion we should be having, and have repeatedly referred to here, about our operating techniques.  I think there are some pr
oblems that we™ve all b
een restive about, but they™re not very easy to handle, as this suggests, in my opinion, and this does raise some points 
that we have to consider carefully. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, gentlemen, I have
 to leave.  I don™t know whether the Committee wants to deliberate furt
her or not.  If there were such a thing as a movement to 
adjourn, would it receive your consent?  Well,
 let™s suppose there is a motion to adjourn. 
9/21/76 - 37 - 
 SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right. 
END OF MEETING
