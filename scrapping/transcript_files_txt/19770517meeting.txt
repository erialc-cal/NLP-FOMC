 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  A motion to approve the 
minutes of the April 19 meeting will now 
be in order. SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any objection to that? 
 We pass now to Mr. Holmes™s report on 
foreign currency operations. MR. HOLMES.  [Secretary's note: This statement was not found in Committee records.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Holmes.  Ar
e there any questions?  I hear none.  A 
motion to approve the transactions on foreign currencies would now be in order. SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

SPEAKER(?).  Second. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Do you have any recommendations, Mr. Holmes? 

MR. HOLMES.  No, Mr. Chairman, except, 
as I mentioned earlier, there may be a 
possibility that we may want to make small drawi
ngs on the swaps.  I think we have the authority to do that.  I have no new recommendations to make. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, then we will 
turn to Mr. Kichline now.  May we have 
your report, Mr. Kichline. MR. KICHLINE.  [Secretary's note: This st
atement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kichline.  Now, we are ready for such views as members of the Committee may have on the state of
 the economy or such questions as they may 
wish.  Mr. Mayo, please.   MR. MAYO.  Just one supplementary comment
, Mr. Chairman.  We have checked out 
some of our heavy-goods industry people since th
e energy message occurred, and they have no 
changes contemplated in their capital
 spending.  Part of this is just time, but to the extent that it™s 
been discussed, and it has been discussed quite a bit in these companies, they see no effect at this 
point on capital plant and equipment spending. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Winn, please. 

MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, the scenario that 
has just been presented, and also it™s in various [staff] books--it seems to me highly prob
able.  On the other hand, I am puzzled by the 
loan demand facet of the future.  When you talk with insurance companies, their backlogs are 

going down, not up.  And this doesn™t look like robust demand.  Second, some of the financing 
5/17/77 - 2 - 
    they are doing [arises from] the fact that some peopl
e feel that interest rates are a little low, and 
they are refinancing their position to take advantage of the interest rate, and that money is not 
going to [be] constructive for future expansion.  The bank demand, 
as I see it, is in part the inventory buildup that is going on currently, and beyond that, we™ve got mortgages and installment credit, some agri
cultural demand, but not a hea
vy push toward expansion.   And the thing that troubles me is, are we s
eeing a little inventory cycle at the moment, 
occasioned by the bad winter weather of the fi
rst two months?  And the plant and equipment 
expansion plans and that sort of thing seem to me
 heavily related to automobiles.  If you take the 
utility component out of it, in th
is sense of the term, and with the feeling that businesses have developed ways of using existing plant and th
e machine tools they™re 
putting in--[they are] providing fantastic increases in output for the capital investment. 
 And are we really going to get the pickup in the investment sector
 that we need in terms of the 
continuation in output?  I just 
raise a questions mark, particular
ly if you look at the lack of financing plans for this sort of expansion.   MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, le
t me clarify the point you made
.  My recollection is that 
the staff memorandum we received indicated th
at the outstanding volume of commitments by 
life and insurance companies was going up.  Did I forget-- 
MR. KICHLINE.  I think the recent data that we
 have from the Life Insurance Association 
of America--and it™s about three-fourths of the 
industry--indicated rising corporate commitments.  
The weak segment continues to be
 the commercial mortgages, but
 that, too, was just edging up a bit.  I think one of the comments that we sorted
 out from our contacts wi
th the insurance industry is that they are literally flooded with funds, and one of the problems, I think, is sorting out the 
extent to which they™d like to invest in high-
yield acceptable instruments relative to the amount 
of money available, and I th
ink they have more money than they see good commitments 
available.  Perhaps it™s that interpretation 
that they are placing upon the flow of funds. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Th
ank you, Mr. Winn.  Mr. Willes, please. 
MR. WILLES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just
 one question.  When our staff worked 
through the numbers for this month, they came out 
in general very close to where you came out.  
They did place less confidence in consumer sp
ending and more confidence in business fixed 
investment.  I just wondered, suppose that c
onsumer spending was not as strong as you are 
assuming; would that really do much to your
 feel for the vigor of the expansion?  
MR. KICHLINE.  Well, I think the key area of 
business investment--tha
t™s the one that has fooled us for some time.  And if we got in
to a situation where consumer spending slowed 
substantially, we could find that business investme
nt plans were deferred, and I think that would pose a risk to our forecast.   I might note, though, that in terms of our cons
umer spending projection, we have looked at that very carefully because it is
 a place where our forecast differs from a number of outside 
forecasters, for example.  And just to indicate
 what we have in the second quarter, we™ve 
assumed an increase in retail sales in May and 
June, 1/4 percent each month.  That will get us on 
average something like a 10-1/2 percent [annual rate] increase in personal consumption 
5/17/77 - 3 - 
    expenditures this quarter, so we have already seen a massive burst of spending.  And secondly, if 
we move into the third quarter, we have in our forecast a dropping off in consumption 

expenditures to about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, so we have allowed, we think, for an appropriate lull in spending.  It gets much worse than that, I think.  It could well be feedback, at that time, in the business equipment area, wh
ich I think does pose a problem there.   MR. EASTBURN.  How soon would you think that feedback would come? MR. KICHLINE.  Well, I think, pe
rhaps by later this year.  We have raised our forecast for this quarter in plant and equipment expenditure
s, and I think the third quarter looks very good, given the orders and shipments data.  But as you 
get on into the fourth quarter and early next year, I think that™s where you mi
ght find something happening.   
MR. EASTBURN.  What kinds of probability 
would you assign to that kind of scenario? 
MR. KICHLINE.  We talked about that--among 
the staff--and I think our assessment is 
rather low.  But not minimal.  I think there is 
a risk, of course, if consumer spending were to 
slow and the momentum that we have now in 
industrial production [were to be maintained],we 
could find inventory backing up a good deal.  And concerns could arise similar to those that 
developed a year ago.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Mr. Baughman now, please. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, we have no 
areas of significant difference with the 
staff™s projection.  It seems a good 
a characterization of prospects to me.  And I guess it probably 
comes as no surprise that the President™s en
ergy program was received with a good deal of 
wailing and gnashing of teeth in the Southwest.  But that notwithstandi
ng, the onshore drilling activity is moving forward very well.  There is literally no idle equipment around, but not enough 
demand pressure [to drive] up prices
 yet, at least.  But probably the most encouraging element is 
that contracts are beginning to work down the idle capacity in offshore drilling rigs, where there 
has been, and still is, a substantial amount of idle capacity.   It seems to me that an area of possible conc
ern are the indications of renewed speculation in real estate.  I would  be interested in anything John Balles might have to report on what I read 
about what™s going on in California.  It seems to me
 I see just mild indications of that sort of 
thing going on in some of the Southwest centers, bot
h with respect to residential properties and with respect to farm and ranch lands.  And it almo
st seems to have some of the flavor of people 
having concluded that money is going to continue to decline in value at a fairly rapid rate.  They might just as well get into a margin situation in 
real estate so long as credit™s available.   And thus far, I have seen no indication that the prospect of increases in the cost of fuel are 
having a locational effect with respect to the areas in which this speculative interest is beginning 

to appear.  That™s all I have to say. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Would you--yes, Mr. Balles. 
MR. BALLES.  Since Ernie has brought up this housing boom situation in California, I suspect I should say a few words on it.  It™s obviously a very unhealthy development, and I 
5/17/77 - 4 - 
    would have to also say it™s being somewhat en
couraged by all the major banks in California 
getting into a second mortgage business.  That us
ed to be anathema in the banking business, but 
there is a great rise in real estate values in 
the residential field because of the population growth 
limitation on available land, or wh
at have you, in California.   It™s not untypical for the prices of houses in suburbs to have about doubled in the last four years.  That suddenly gives people a lot bigger equity position, and the major banks in the state are now promoting a second deed of trust at a 12 percent interest rate--take a trip around the world or invest, send your kids to college, or do anything you like with the money.  And I am 
afraid a lot of people are taking this equity out of their present homes and using it for speculation 
in other houses.  We have seen instances in 
which this has been reported by several of our directors, where, before the builder even has 
the houses up, he™s got all the sales completed, and 
the minute somebody buys it they can turn around 
and sell it within 10 minutes at a $10,000 or 
$20,000 profit.   There™s something wrong with the pricing system
.  The builders themselves aren™t setting a 
high enough price on it.  But that sort of speculative bubble is bound to come to an end at some 
point.  And when it does come to an end, there is goi
ng to be a lot of lending institutions left with some bad loans.  Now, fortunately, some of our 
banks and some of the S&Ls have taken steps to 
try to head this off.  The Home Loan Bank incr
eased its lending rate by a full percentage point not long ago.  Some banks are requiring that borro
wers sign a statement that they will occupy the 
residence or the house that they are going to buy, or not sell, within two years.  There have been a number of such statements.   
But unfortunately, like shoveling sand against the tides, speculative profits are so large that a 1 point increase in interest rates or the requirement to sign a 
statement that you don™t move out 
or intend to sell this property or intend to hol
d it for investment--people will sign those things 
lying through their teeth.  So we don™t know quite how to come to grips with it, but it™s not a healthy development. 
MR. MAYO.  I might add, Mr. Chairman, that 
farmland values and sales prices in the 
Midwest are continuing up.  We have
 10 percent higher just in the first quarter of this year.  We 
were expecting that this would level off.  This is a 40 percent annual rate--sales are basically at a 40 percent higher price than they were this time a year ago.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  These are very disturbi
ng comments.  I am not too aware of the 
speculation and things going on in California. 
 Which banks are involved in the second mortgages? MR. BALLES.  My recollection, right off the top of my head, Mr. Chairman, is that there 
is not a single major bank that isn™t involved. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Does our staff know anything about this? MR. KICHLINE.  We™re familiar with the hous
ing situation in Southern California, 
especially, but I™m not familiar with the second mortgage situation.  
5/17/77 - 5 - 
    MR. JACKSON.  This is nothing new, Mr. Chairman.  This has been going on all 
throughout the country for the last 10 years or 
so.  Really, consumer finance companies have 
offered this type of financing.  Their experience has been excellent.  The last nationwide figures I saw for one of them showed a net underwriting prof
it instead of a loss.  In other words, they had no loss whatever.  Many of the bank holding companie
s have entered into this type of activity 
through  their consumer finance subsidiaries.  Th
eir experience thus far has been generally good.  I would suspect that if you looked at the actual loan-to-value ratios, you would find that the first 
and second mortgage combined wouldn™t exceed
 a prudent first mortgage whatever, and 
probably the combined debt service would not be
 materially more burdensome than that on a 
first mortgage at current rates. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, I think-- 

MR. JACKSON.  I need to be shown the figures to see that this is wild speculation on the banks™ part because it™s a practi
ce that™s been pretty well known throughout the country in the 
last 10 years. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think I would want to see the figures to see whether it is or isn™t.  
I think we need to gather evidence, and I think our staff should look into this very promptly.  MR. WALLICH.  This, I think, performs a func
tion.  People have substantial capital gains in their homes.  All they get out of it so far, if they don™t refinance, is higher taxes, so they actually think they™re poorer when their wea
lth has increased.  Their consumption could 
legitimately rise.  So therefor
e, a question of how soundly this financing is handled--but basically, I think this is a logical and good development, where th
e financing system fills a gap 
which so far has not been filled properly--how to cash in on these capital gains that are quite 

invaluable. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Why aren™t these mort
gages refinanced?  Why a second mortgage 
at 12 percent instead of a first mortgage at 8-3/4 or 9?  
MR. JACKSON.  Because many times the existi
ng first mortgage, which may be assumed 
or retained, is at such a low interest rate--4, 5, 6, or 7 percent--that the combined total cost of the 
two produces a lower cost to the customer than a 
refinance rate at current rates, which now have risen to the 9 to 9-1/4 rate, I understand, out there.  Is that correct, John?   
MR. BALLES.  That™s right.  The prime le
nding rate on [mortgages] for good property has 
gone up about a half point.  But in response to your comment, Phil, I agre
e that there is nothing new in this in terms of the principle.  But what
 is [new] in my opinion is the intensity of the 
speculation to get amateurs of all kinds buying 
these second and third houses, renting them out 
for awhile, and hoping to make a 
killing.  And, you know, as long as values stay up, that™s fine, but if the values collapse, [there™s] going to be some people unable to service those second 
mortgages, in my opinion. 
MR. PARTEE.  Are these real estate loans, John?  Do they classify them as real estate? 
MR. BALLES.  Yes. 5/17/77 - 6 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  So they are primarily secured by the real estate. 
MR. BALLES.  The second deed of trust.  And it™s not just the banks, it™s the S&Ls, too, that are doing it.  MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, I think a similar phenomenon is occurring, as Bob Mayo has 
said, in bank loans to farmers.  These loans are frequently predicated on the value of the land, 

which has been speculatively bid up terribly and unrealistically high in Illinois and Missouri and places like that.  And the farmer™s 
ability to repay in many instances
 is limited by the income that 
he can earn off of working that land. There is an imbalance developing due to the exte
nt of credit the bank is willing to make 
and extend and the inability of the farmer to wo
rk his land in a manner to service that loan, 
which is really a larger loan th
an he normally would be entitled to because of the speculative 
increase in value of the land.  If this bubble bursts, it could be terribly serious to the agricultural economy, as I understand.   
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, there are two aspect
s of this farm pricing question.  Some of 
it is accounted for by speculators.  A large pa
rt of it, however, is accounted for by dollar averaging by the existing farmers who have such 
a low price basis for their existing farms that 
they can get their neighbor™s farm at a decent pric
e--I should say, even at an inflated price.  It 
still pays them to pick up that property and, in effect, dollar average it in, and they can still make 
money on that basis.   The part of it that worries me most, though, is
 those, like [those in] John™s statement, who 
are amateurs in this business.  And to the extent
 that they can persuade farm organizations and 
congressmen and so forth for greater price supports 
for aid to agriculture to, in effect, support the value of their farm later on--this is something 
that isn™t too evident yet, but it may be--  
MR. BAUGHMAN.  It™s not evident to the farmers yet. 

MR. MAYO.  Not as such. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Mr. Chairman, as an addendum 
to what Bob Mayo has said, I would also note that this increase in the farm values in our
 part of [the country] is the support for the bank loan to these farmers and ranchers--they have not
 sold their crops since ™75 and ™76--they™re in business to put a new crop in.  
It is a support that permits additional lending to those units. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I continue to think that this is a dist
urbing development.  
When you can pick up a piece of real estate at one 
price today and sell it at a profit the next day 
or the next week, you™ve got a real estate boom 
that can™t last.  And the world has had a great 
deal of experience with that, and I™ve lived through more than one real 
estate cycle like that. 
MR. LILLY.  Well, I think, J
ohn, isn™t this pretty well isolated down around San Diego, the intensity of this boom?  
MR. BALLES.  It™s more pervasive in Southe
rn California than in 
Northern California. 5/17/77 - 7 - 
    MR. LILLY.  Even less than Southern California, as I remember your board meeting last 
week.  They talked about how, really, around San Diego-- MR. BALLES.  Actually, it™s in Orange County [unintelligible], east of Los Angeles, but it™s certainly not limited to that.  
MR. PARTEE.  Well, people offer more money 
every day for that property down there and 
[unintelligible].  It must give
 a sense of speculative opportunity--every day the paper has got a new higher price bid for that urban property. MR. ROOS.  But this is also happening in farm land, a very similar occurrence.  It isn™t 
just residential property, that type of speculation.  I think the land that Mr. Mayo speaks of has been bid up unrealistically, and it has [been] in Missouri and some of these other areas 
[unintelligible]. MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, there is another 
side of this that I think is sometimes 
overlooked.  We pay attention to 
the behavior of the stock mark
et, that is, what it does to people™s attitudes and their spending plans and so forth.  But when we take a look at the financial assets of the consumer, we forget the changes in 
market value that have taken place in this real 
estate area.  And some of the de
bt-equity ratios really are quite a great deal better for the time 
being if you take market values 
than when you take costs on some of these things.  And it affects 
the consumer™s willingness to spend because of 
the fact that the values have gone way up and 
[they™re used] to borrow again rather than to sell or something of that kind.  So there is another 
side of this value change that I think is important, frankly.   
MR. WALLICH.  This [is] compensation for th
e very high rates of interest that people have to pay.  Unless the property goes up, there is really no justification [for borrowing], but they are collecting for the interest
 by remortgaging the property. 
MR. JACKSON.  To what extent have we seen a growth in the use of marg
in accounts for personal consumption purposes versus securities 
purchases?  Is there any indication of that--I 
know there are several plans afloat that would relate the two types of financing so that you could use a margin account for personal consumption purposes. 
MR. KICHLINE.  I™m not aware 
of any dollar magnitudes that 
are available on that.  The 
aggregate use of margin credit ha
s been increasing and is now at a new high level.  It™s about a billion dollars over what it was six months ago. 
 But I™m not aware to what extent it™s to 
purchase securities as opposed to withdrawing the funds from the account. 
MR. MORRIS.  I think there has been a good deal
 of that, Phil, simply because the brokers 
find that they can offer better rates than the banks, and I think another piece of evidence is that 
the performance of the stock market
 relative to the growth in margin
 credit is much weaker than 
you would otherwise anticipate.   MR. JACKSON.  Well, that™s my judgment. 
 It™s obvious the money is going someplace. 
5/17/77 - 8 - 
    MR. MORRIS.  Because otherwise you™ve got
 to assume [unintelligible]--somebody™s 
moving out of the market and allowi
ng the little guy to take it over, and that doesn™t seem to fit 
the facts. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the last two years 
have been characterized, by and large, by remarkable [unintelligible] from excesses and specul
ation.  This is the first significant sign that I 
have heard of and I™d like to see this watched very carefully.  And I think that [in any] study that 
our staff may be undertaking, it would be very usef
ul to comment on this phenomenon in the real 
estate market, urban and rural, that we have 
just been discussing, to comment on that in the Redbook.  And who™s responsible for the Redbook, Mr. Kichline? MR. KICHLINE.  The System Research Advisory Committee. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Will you make sure that 
whoever is responsible gets on top of it 
promptly, and next month we will get reports
 through the Redbook on this alleged phenomenon. 
MR. KICHLINE.  All right. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Black, may we hear from you now? 
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, I find myself 
in close agreement with Mr. Kichline™s 
assessment of the business outlook, in particul
ar for the outlook in plant and equipment 
expenditures.  I was puzzled about one thing, Jim, on [page] II-15 in the Greenbook, where you 

have the Commerce Department series on cont
racts and orders for plant and equipment. 
MR. KICHLINE.  Yes. 

MR. BLACK.  The last couple of lines there show weakness of the last two months, 
February and March--and I™m just wondering if
 there were special factors in the private nonbuilding area for utilities and pipelines, or something of that sort, that would account for that 
weakness there.  All the other indicators would be sort of strong in the direction you have indicated. MR. KICHLINE.  I truthfully don™t know--this is a highly volatile series, as you know.  I think that is part of it; the w
eather effect may have been anot
her.  We have also heard at 
McGraw-Hill that the bulge in March reflected so
me contracts that were
 just reaching fruition 
about the same time, and it may be sort of a 
lumping problem over the February-March period.  
But I am not aware of anything.  Jerry, maybe you are? 
MR. ZEISEL.  No. 

MR. BLACK.  What I™m really trying to get 
at is whether the nonbuilding part of it-- MR. PARTEE.  It almost has to be, if you read
 that footnote.  That™s the only thing that isn™t shown separately.   MR. BLACK.  But I was wondering whether it was just an aberration or whether that could be a weakness that might 
overwhelm the strength received. 
5/17/77 - 9 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  When I read that table,
 I was disturbed by exactly the same point.  
Then I consulted the table on page 12, which seemed to contain a reassuring answer--that is, you 
find that, according to the latest McGraw-H
ill survey, expenditures--plant and equipment 
expenditures [for] electric utilit
ies are scheduled, if these figu
res can be trusted, to go up by 21 percent, and for gas utilities by 34 percent, and you find a sharp increase in the estimates 
prepared in February for those occurring two mo
nths later.  So it l
ooks like an aberration.  MR. BLACK.  Well, that™s what I felt.  It wa
s because everything seemed to indicate that it 
might be, but I just wanted to go ahea
d and take the information on it anyway. 
MR. KICHLINE.  I™m sorry we don™t-- 

MR. BLACK.  Well, I think Chairman Burn
s has confirmed my feelings about it, by 
pointing these things out, that™s certainly not [unintelligible]. MR. PARTEE.  Well, it™s also, 
if you look at the last column 
there, the year-over-year is much less, possibly, than the other component.  The other component would have to be remarkably weak.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think this is somethi
ng that should be looked into.  There are margins of uncertainty throughout. 
MR. KICHLINE.  Fine. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  Mr. Partee now, please. MR. PARTEE.  Well, I want to return to th
is question of a possible pattern developing throughout the year.  I certainly agree that all of the figures currently look very strong.  One can™t really find anything--except for the concern about the rate of inflation--to be very disturbed about with the performance of the economy 
in the last couple of months.   
But it is also true, as a number [of us] have
 pointed out, that the configuration could be something like that of last year.  As I recall, reta
il sales rose strongly in the first few months last year to a March or April point--I would say a decline, although I think there were a couple of months of decline, and then [it] leveled out for the next six months.  And it wasn™t very long at all before that had a marked eff
ect on inventory attitudes, in particular.  And the question is, is there enough strength elsewhere in the economy to offset the possi
bility of that occurring again, and you have it in a modest degree, in the sense 
that you™re bringing up the saving rate gradually over the next couple of quarters, so your increases in consumer spending are less than they have been running.   But it isn™t a leveling off, by any means, that
 you have.  And in that connection, I notice  that the March inventory numbers, I think it was March, really we
re pretty large.  Thirty billion or 31 billion in the supplement, and that made 
me wonder about the first quarter GNP numbers.  
So far, I guess, we™ve just had the Commerce pre
liminary, and there™ll be
 a final or semifinal 
here in a few days.  It could be that that inventory numb
er is already higher than we think it is.  
Jerry, do you have a view on that?  
5/17/77 - 10 - 
    MR. ZEISEL.  Well, yes, there was a very larg
e increase, particularly in retail trading 
inventories in March. MR. PARTEE.  Yes, but the total is $33 billion; that™s quite a large number.   MR. ZEISEL.  The $33 billion for total business--manufacturing and trade, the average for 
the first quarter is about $30 billion.  Given the very rapid increase in wholesale prices, our IVA is jumping and now is somewhere in the low 20s, so 
that it™s possible that 
the inventory figure, as you suggest, may be stronger in the fi
rst quarter.  I wouldn™t expect it to be a great deal stronger.  It is a little hard to make out that retail trad
e inventory figure for March because it comes in the 
face of very strong growth in sales and perhap
s, quite frankly, [is] a bit surprising.   
In terms of the point about consumption, Govern
or, Jim earlier cited the increases that we 
are projecting for personal consumption expenditures 
in current dollar terms.  I think the story as 
we can foresee it is even clearer if you look at it in real terms. 
 For the second half of 1977, we™re forecasting about 3-1/4 percent real
 rates of growth for personal consumption expenditures.  And 
that™s really quite modest.  In terms of the possibi
lities of a weakening, of c
ourse, they are there.  And there™s a very real concern about that, but we have had fair
ly substantial gains in income 
recently; wages and salaries have been rising at
 1-1/2 percent per month for the last several 
months, and that gives a strong basis for continuing growth in consumer outlets.  And our 
judgment is that even with the slowing down of
 personal consumption expenditures to something 
like a 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate, there™s enough strength evident in the other sectors of the economy 
to keep the momentum moving at something cl
ose to 5-1/2 to 6 percent overall for GNP.  
MR. PARTEE.  But you do have every line moving up strongly.  Except net exports, 
which moved up slightly; but everything else is 
moving up strongly in order to give you this 
5-1/2 percent for GNP.   MR. ZEISEL.  We have busine
ss fixed investment certainly
 moving up strongly.  I must say, our assumption about inventories remains appr
oximately what it has been in recent months, 
to wit, a rather conservative rate of growth.  The inventory-sales ratios continue edging off all 
through 1977, and we just turned them around as we move into 1978.  That I consider 
conservative, given the projection of business fixed investment we have in there.  There™s 
generally a buildup of durable goods inventories that is associated with that, and so I think that™s a conservative picture.  We do have considerable strength in residential constructi
on for the next couple of quarters, but I think that™s pretty well in the bag with the kind of increase we™ve already had in housing starts.  So we [have what] I think in those two sectors are reasonable views on what is likely to happen.   Certainly, I think the key to this is really 
business fixed investment, as Mr. Kichline said 
earlier; if we don™t get the kind of growth that we are now antic
ipating, then the economy could well falter later in the year.  But we have had so
me fairly good news there.  The orders figures 
have held up well.  McGraw-Hill survey figures have come in quite strong, the backlog of orders 

has begun to build for nondefense capital equipmen
t, so there seems to be a basis for assuming 
continued growth. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, we 
will hear from Mr. Wallich now, please. 
5/17/77 - 11 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  I wanted to a
ddress myself to the same subj
ect as Chuck and look a little farther ahead, if possible.  This recovery is now entering its third year, so it™s beginning to be an old one, and while there are no clear imbalances-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  An old one with new life. 

MR. WALLICH.  --a new one, maybe with new 
life; we certainly wish it a long and happy life.  But what I seem to see in
 the projections is some kind of 
a rolling readjustment, with some 
things losing strength and other things therefore necessa
rily being relied on to gain strength if the expansion is to continue.  So if housing were 
weak--you™ve still got it very strong, but you™ve got 
good reasons why it should come down:  flows of f
unds, interest rates.  Consumption has carried 
this expansion for a long time, autos have been 
very important in it--w
e could easily, with the savings rate rising, have some sl
owing there.  And government, while scheduled to be strong the 
next couple of quarters, also into 1978 tapers off.   And what we have is businesses fixed investment hopefully coming along and the very 
strong inventory numbers in the middle of 1978.  Thos
e are the two big elemen
ts of the strength.  Both are not assured.  It™s conceivable that one could have a cycle without an investment surge, 
and it is conceivable that that cycle can peter out
 without ever reaching a credit climax.  At any 
rate, I think what one has to accept is that the elements that 
are carrying the thing forward are changing guard.  And what™s carried it so far will probably be relieved , in the next quarter or two, by some of these new forces, if things work out right. MR. PARTEE.  But there could well be a pause there; you mentioned new cars.  I recall 1955 as a year in which new car sales were extremely strong for a while, and when they fell off, why there wasn™t really anything.  Well, the economy continued a
ll right, but there was a pause in the sense that there wasn™t
 anything to take their place. 
MR. WALLICH.  In those days I think your
 report, Mr. Chairman, called it a rolling 
readjustment, and [it] went from one sector of st
rength to another sector of strength, and so there was hope the business cycle had been overcome. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  As I remember that period, you had a decline in automobile 
production, and that was accompanied by a declin
e in homebuilding, and those economists who 
look upon those two industries as dominating the economy were
 crying, ﬁWe must have a 
depression, it™s coming immediately.ﬂ  Eventually 
they were right, but we had a considerable period of expansion with these two factors of the economy moving down and other factors 
compensating for that decline.  
MR. WALLICH.  Right, there wa
s a real sequence, first housing in ™54, then cars in ™55, and plant and equipment thereafter, so it was really
 going from one support to another.  It™s just a question of whether these things will always show up in time.  
MR. COLDWELL.  Jim, what™s your balance 
between industrial production and inventory gain?  You™ve had about a 2-1/2 
to 3 percent increase in industrial production, first quarter, and I noticed looking down here that, taking off from the third 
quarter of 1977, our industrial production growth--7.8, 8.8, 9.0, 10.1--a steady rise throughout this.  Is this balanced between industrial production and inventory? 5/17/77 - 12 - 
    MR. KICHLINE.  I think the gains in industr
ial production--I don™t have the numbers right 
handy--were stronger through the first quarter on average.  I think it is closer to 5 percent.  And given the strong surge in sales, the inventory numbers that 
we have, and what we would anticipate for the second quarter, mu
ch of the production is going in
to final consumption.  It is 
not showing up in inventories.   Most recently, in looking at the industrial production index, there has been a pickup, however, in nondurable goods supplies, materials and supplies, and so if you look back in terms 
of stable processing, we™re getting a buildup there, which will feed through.  And I think that™s where the inventories are now concentrated; it™s in its early production process.  And I would not view the current numbers as being out of 
balance.  Jerry, would you have a comment? 
MR. ZEISEL.  No, I think, Governor, that you were making a valid point in the sense that 
there is a somewhat closer rela
tionship between the growth in industrial production and real final sales than between industrial production and, let™s say, the commodity portions of GNP at the moment, because of the relatively sluggish growth 
in inventories.  We expect that industrial 
production will be rising relatively more rapidly in 
GNP later on as we start building inventories.  
The relationship is really quite close over the last couple of quarters, but by late this year, we expect growth rates of industrial production in the 8 to 9 percent range as inventories are built. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I wonder if it™s inventories.  I wonder if inventories are the reconciling factor or the e
xpenditures on services.   MR. ZEISEL.  Well, I--aren™t they really basically the same? 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You and I are not on the same track.  Go on, just elucidate your 
thought. MR. ZEISEL.  The balance of gross national product has been heavily toward services, in part because of the lack of investment in inventories.  If there we
re more rapid rates of growth of 
inventories, that sector of the economy would be growing somewh
at more strongly, and so the balance between services and goods would be so
mewhat more normal than it™s been recently. 
MR. COLDWELL.  You lost me a litt
le bit on that last comment.   
MR. PARTEE.  Inventory to services-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  Well, I under
stand that.  Coming back to the inventory question, 
though, I™m just a little bit puzzle
d.  Jerry, if you take an early inventory buildup in nondurables at the manufactures level, which I believe is wh
at Jim said, do we have enough track record to 
call that a forecasting development to [an] en
larged total inventory, and does the balance 
between your industrial production, with that track record, give you pause for thought?  An inventory cycle question.  MR. KICHLINE.  I think it depends very heavily on one™s expecta
tion for sales and-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  But you said yours was going down. 
5/17/77 - 13 - 
    MR. KICHLINE.  That™s right, but the inventory growth that we have projected is really 
quite moderate relative to sales, so we still have
 in our projection, in each of the four quarters this year, a decline in th
e inventory-sales ratio.   MR. COLDWELL.  That™s exactly my point.  
That™s where I think I get off the track--I 
think that the inventory-sales ratio either should level off or go up.  If sales weaken and you continue your industrial production-- MR. KICHLINE.  Well, the arithme
tic, I think, is correct, so what one has to focus on is the two parts of that ratio.  Either you get a faster increase in production--a buildup in inventories--or alternatively, sales don™t keep pace and production adjustments come along with 
a lag and you get this buildup in the ratio becau
se sales tend to falter while production is still 
roaring along.  We don™t have that in our forecast;
 it™s one of those things that obviously could 
happen, and it did, indeed, happen last year. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Y
ou do have a rapid increase in the inventory-sales ratio in early 1978?   
MR. KICHLINE.  Right.  It™s in the first quarter, I think; it begins to turn around, and in the second quarter of 1978, we have it bouncing up. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, Mr. Eastburn. 

MR. EASTBURN.  I™d like to come back again 
for a minute to this question of a possible 
lull or rolling readjustment.  We™ve been talking 
about this, too, and I think the probabilities that 
I would assign would agree with the ones that you have.  At the same time, I™ve been concerned 
about the possibilities for further price increases.  And I™m just
 wondering whether some kind of 
a rolling process, as long as it doesn™t adversely affect the capital goods area, might not be just 
what we need, in terms of the price pressures 
we might be experienci
ng later on this year.  Would you think that if those probabilities were to materialize a
nd we were to have something 
like the situation that we had a year ago, that this would have a material effect on the price 
changes?  
MR. KICHLINE.  If we had something like we
 had a year ago, I think we™d be talking about significantly less real gr
owth in total.  And I must 
say, personally, I™m getting a bit 
discouraged with the behavior of markets in terms of pricing behavi
or relative to the strength of markets.  I think increasingly, the staff is convin
ced that transactions prices in many areas are 
differing from list prices, and that™s in part confusing the situation, in that many industries are 
attempting to push through price increases at ev
ery opportunity.  And more recently, we have 
had reports that, with the pickup in demand in certain
 areas, there™s been a very rapid increase in prices, but at the same time, it has not been affected
 in terms of the actual 
transactions prices.   And so it™s not at all clear to me--the impact 
of this so-called rolli
ng readjustment on actual 
transaction prices.  I think that it could well be that you begin to get, in some areas like capital 
goods, some price increases that we haven™t seen 
yet because there hasn™t been a good deal of 
strength.  In other areas, it may 
well be that list prices don™t ch
ange very much, so that the indexes as they measure prices perh
aps are giving us a poor reading.   5/17/77 - 14 - 
    It certainly can™t hurt; it runs in the direction of lessening price pressures.  I think this is 
particularly important in the housing area, which 
is the one place where we have heard reports of 
potential supply problems with wall
board, insulation, that sort of thing.  So with a slowdown in housing for example, I think it [uni
ntelligible] the price problem--   
MR. PARTEE.  But your overall industrial utilization figures are not so high until you get into next year, I think by the middle of ™78.  That™s a pretty high number. 
MR. KICHLINE.  They get in to the 85, 86 percent range. 
MR. PARTEE.  A lot of inventory accumu
lation, and then an 86 percent capacity utilization rate.  But for the time being, you don™t 
have that overall utilization pressure.  And what Dave said occurred, you have to rememb
er--the effect would be a higher unemployment 
rate.  In other words, if there were slower real growth.  And the question is, What would be a 
congressional response to the higher unemp
loyment rate? MR. EASTBURN.  Well, the irony 
of it would be, Chuck--and this was the thrust of my 
question--that you might suffer a higher unemploym
ent rate and still gain no ground on the price front. MR. PARTEE.  You might, yes. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You sound like a very discouraging lot.  We seem to be looking 
for trouble.  Speculating about possible sources of trouble.  Why don™t we look for possible sources of price stability, possible sources of encouraging, balanced economic growth?  Mr. 
Kimbrel, perhaps you™ll supply that function.   
MR. KIMBREL.  Well, Mr. Chairman, indeed, in
 our area, we are hearing an awful lot of very happy news.  Everything is relative, though, I guess.  But I was concerned at our breakfast meeting last Friday and in some of our sessions 
very recently with businessmen that, for the first 
time, we™ve been observing purchases anticipating hi
gh prices or anticipating the possibilities of some slow deliveries.  I wonder if 
you are observing this in other areas. MR. KICHLINE.  Jerry, would you--Jerry has been watching this particular situation. MR. ZEISEL.  There hasn™t been too much; there have been some
 reports in that direction.  We don™t have very great quantitative information, but you have
 the reports of purchasing agents, which seem to be fairly concrete, and th
ere has been some tendency in that direction, but 
nobody is complaining very greatly yet, as far as I can tell. MR. PARTEE.  From deliverywise?  

MR. ZEISEL.  Deliverywise. 
MR. KIMBREL.  You would not assign a great dimension of current purchases against 
borrowing from the future. 
MR. ZEISEL.  On the part of consumers or on the part of businessmen? 
5/17/77 - 15 - 
    MR. KIMBREL.  Well, businessmen. 
MR. ZEISEL.  It™s a little hard to evaluate since we have no real concrete information.  But 
it would seem to me that, given the generally av
ailable capacity and no significant indications of shortages in the immediate futu
re, I wouldn™t think that there would be too much stockpiling 
except as you suggested, some possibility 
of anticipating further price increases. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimbrel.  Mr. Volcker, please. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don™t know whether I want to add a great note of cheer around the table, Mr. Chairman.  I came in fee
ling somewhat the way Mr. Winn started us off 
with, maybe a little more reason for uneasiness ab
out the pattern over time.  I think our basic 
forecast is a little stronger in the short run and a 
little weaker as time passes.  There seems to be 
something--I don™t necessarily ha
ve a better projection to offer--but something inherently 
improbable about the inventories proceeding quite
 so smoothly as the staff has it here, with 
steady increases through the next four quarters.  I would think that might come a little sooner in 
terms of big increases and take some of the strength 
out of the latter quarters.  As I listen to this conversation, this kind of uneasiness gets reinforced, and I do have a feeling that maybe it™s 
going too far.  I don™t necessarily anticipate quite as smooth an a
dvance as has been presented by the staff this morning.  I™m not sure-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Let me just say a word 
about the staff. Chances are that members 
of the staff have thought of many of the uncertain
ties that have been mentioned around the table, 
but they don™t know how to translate that into numbers over time, so they have a smooth-- 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That™s right, that always happens in forecasting, and I 
sympathize. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  If I may say--add another wo
rd--I have the feeling that this is true 
of much of mankind--it™s certain
ly true of this Committee toda
y--we do a constant amount of worrying.  We don™t have real problems to worry 
about, but we™ll still worry, and we will create 
problems. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I agree with all that, but I still have a little more worry.  
Not quite as much as the general tone that™s emerged.  Yes, I think for the first time, maybe, in 
this expansion you can begin pointing to some thi
ngs that could develop in an unsustainable way over time.  But maybe the most serious thing in 
the background is, I don™t like the way prices, and particularly costs on the compensation side
, are developing.  They are not developing as smoothly or as optimistically as I thought some
 months ago.  And I do share the comment that Mr. Kichline made in that respect just now, 
that my earlier optimism on that score is being 
somewhat eroded.  I don™t think it is a good thing, 
in a vague way, looking out [to] the expansion 
a year from now.  But also, it has interesting im
plications for how you handle this in terms of 
policy.  This is a main source of concern. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Perhaps the only word that I can add to this discussion is that, we 
are having, I think, a very normal expansion. 
 That™s all that I see, with all the uncertainties--prices accelerating, an
d there will continue to be surprises--but I see nothing 
abnormal about the expansion so far.   
5/17/77 - 16 - 
    The one disturbing thing that I™ve heard was what Mr. Balles developed, the facts that he presented, and then Mr. Mayo, Mr. Roos, about farm 
real estate values.  That™s something that 
doesn™t develop on a significant scale in every business cycle expansion.  And when it does, yes, it will go for a while, but it carries the seeds of tr
ouble, and therefore, we will have to watch that 
carefully.  Who else would like to speak now on the state of the economy? 
MR. PARTEE.  May I ask, that first-quarter compensation increase had some--was 
more--and perhaps you were referring to that, Paul, about the faster compensa
tion rates.  But that had some special factors in it, didn™t it? 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, the first quarter was certainly more, but if you just 
look at the projections beyond the first quarter, it is also more than
 it was last year, although not as much as the first quarter.  
MR. PARTEE.  Are we seeing a speed-up in the size of contract settlements or nonunion 
wages?  Are they accelerating?  Is there anyt
hing detectible as yet in the figures on that? MR. ZEISEL.  It™s a mixed pictur
e.  I hate to use that phrase, but it is.  You mentioned the 
contract settlements in the first quarter.  They we
re not out of line with what we had been having through 1976.  But there has been a distinct speed-up in average hourly earnings, and we think that this is a function in part
 of the composition of recent employment growth being oriented 
toward high-wage industries, which happens to jack the figures up.  But also, there are hints that earnings may be rising a little more rapidly than
 we thought, and we have built in a slightly 
larger projection of compensation for 1977 this
 time than last.  
It™s about 3/10 more. 
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It discourages me about th
is a little bit more.  One more comment on this point, purely a qualitative reaction.  The more time passes, businesses seem to 
take it more and more for granted that you give
 a 9 to 10 percent [compensation] increase, and 
we don™t even raise much questi
on about it.  It™s the normal, 
expected way the economy works these days.  It seems to be part of the menta
lity.  I don™t know how you get out of this syndrome. 
MR. GARDNER.  Just a question, Jerry.  What 
does the staff think about the proposal to increase Social Security withholding applied solely to the employer? 
MR. ZEISEL.  It™s going to be expensive.  Obviously that goes directly into labor costs.  The proposals, which carry through over a number 
of years and eventually involve no ceiling on employer contributions, run into a fair amount of
 money.  We have some rough estimates of the 
amount.  Most of that is far off, several years 
from now.  The adjustments that we™ve already had 
are fairly significant; let™s see-- 
MR. PARTEE.  It must be at 
least 1 percent 
of payroll. MR. ZEISEL.  It runs above 1 percent of payroll, Governor.  I think, if I remember 
correctly, the adjustments run 1, 1-1/2, and 2 pe
rcent of payroll over three succeeding years. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I hate to join the questioners and doubters, but I have to at this point.  Not so long ago the Administration 
made a proposal to its Congress, namely that 
business firms be granted a tax credit in the amo
unt of 4 percent of their payments on account of 
5/17/77 - 17 - 
    the Social Security tax, and this measure was desc
ribed as an employment stimulating measure.  
This was a minuscule reduction of taxes for bus
iness firms, and that minuscule reduction was 
designed to increase employment.  And now we 
have a massive increase in taxes on employers 
proposed by the Administration, and not a word is 
said about the effect that that may have on 
employment. 
MR. PARTEE.  Oh, no, no, on the contrary.  The Secretary was asked about that, and he said that it would have no effects on employment.  And then he
 was asked about the effects on prices, and he said it would have no effects on prices.  And the reason is the business would absorb costs.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That hardly improves th
e thinking process that is going on in this area. 
MR. KICHLINE.  Mr. Chairman, we have an
 explicit estimate of the Administration 
proposal.  Governor Gardner, [for] the first 
quarter of 1979, which is when it will become 
effective, our estimate is th
at it will add 1-1/2 percentage points annual rate to total compensation, 2 percentage points in
 the first quarter  of 1980, and 2-1/2 percentage points in the first quarter of 1981. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You know, if I were a businessman today, I think I would be 
bewildered.  Here you have something called an
 energy policy, and this energy policy contains the most massive tax bill ever presented to C
ongress.  With taxes running up, money being taken 
out of one set of pocketbooks in the amount 
of perhaps $70 billion per year by 1985, and the money going elsewhere--it isn™t at all clear into which pocketbooks that money would go.  And also the Social Security tax and the re
bate one day and down the next day.   I think I™d be a little confused, and as a businessman, I think what I want--and Dave, I™m 
looking at you to refute or confirm what I™m sayi
ng--I think I could live with a tax gain within broad limits, aggressive, encouraging, mild--but I 
need stability.  I™m not 
getting much stability 
in the area or I™m thinking about the tax area a
nd I think I would find that very disturbing if I were a practicing businessman.  Am I making sense? 
MR. LILLY.  Well, if you will remember when
 you were talking about a speech you were giving on this subject, I suggested you say that
, until we have an energy policy, there™s more 
uncertainty than ever.  And the minute that all 
of the proposals have gone to Congress, we have had some kind of a policy--I guess you™d call it a no-policy policy--on energy.  Now we have a 

series of proposals for a policy which is adding even more to the confusion, and until the 
Congress works through the package, the uncertainty is going to be higher, and that™s why I thought it was appropriate that you suggest to the Congress that they hustle the thing along.   There is a great deal of uncertainty right now.  However, people are also feeling very good.  I™m a little surprised to find this group feeling as somewhat depressed as it is.  All of the 

directors meetings that I™ve b
een to around the country have been uniformly bullish.  I went down to the Business Council meetin
g last Friday, and other than this squabble with [special 
adviser to the President on energy, James] Schles
inger, they were very bullish.  I™m concerned 
5/17/77 - 18 - 
    that there may be too much bullishness in the ai
r, and I™m concerned about some lag effects in 
what™s happening in the interest rate structure. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you.  Mr. Guffey, you will now speak. 

MR. GUFFEY.  I can only observe--the philosophy of these meetings seems to be, if 
things are going well at the present, the meeting ge
ts longer because of th
e [unintelligible].  And I would suggest, as Chuck has mentioned earlier, 
we have had rain in the Midwest--spring has arrived, the sap is rising.  There is an increased demand in the recreational areas of Wyoming 
and in Colorado for condominiums, which is some
thing we have not seen over the last two or three years.   
And another sort of interesting thing that™s heard--the announcement of the energy package 
or proposed legislation has apparently not deterred those looking for gas and oil drilling operations, because the loan demand at the banks ha
s continued to increase, even in view of the 
supposed uncertainty.  Now, whether or not this 
was something that was in the pipeline before 
and is just now being taken down, or whether these people are just overlooking the uncertainties that hinge on the policy is not clear.  But it is
 going forward; the drilling is accelerating in our 
part of the country really nicely.  Things look good in the western part of the Midwest.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, I think this 
is a very good time to stop our discussion 
on the state of the economy.  Mr. Sternlight, would you like to report on operations of the Desk? MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Statement--see Appendix.] 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We™ll continue our deliberations and go along with Mr. Axilrod™s statement.  Mr. Axilrod. 
MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This stat
ement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Axilrod.  We are ready now to discuss the reports 
by Mr. Sternlight and by Mr. Axilrod.  Mr. Coldwell? MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Axilrod, in forecasting th
e aggregates over the remainder of May 
and early June, my recollection is
 that you are looking at about 4 to 5 for May and 1 to 2 for June.  Does your cutback reflect the idea that April is now explained at least partly in a seasonal, or is this a stock and flow concept--there™s enough in the hands of the consumer to do what he 
wants to do over the next month? 
MR. AXILROD.  It™s the latter, principally, Governor Coldwell.  There™s enough in the hands of the consumer now, or in the public
, generally financed in the second quarter transactions.  Our second quarter growth rate, as I mentioned, is still a relatively high 9-1/4 
percent.  So we have not assumed that, say, a half
 or even two-thirds of that April growth was money that was going to be offset by negative numbers.  We believe
, or I believe in any event, a large part of that reflected the strengthening of
 the economy and will be reflected in the higher 
growth rate in the second quarter, and increased velocity.  5/17/77 - 19 - 
    MR. COLDWELL.  Well, I may be missing someth
ing in the rationale here, but see if you 
can help me.  If this is a position in which suffi
cient [funds have] been created now to handle the second quarter™s expenditures, and we still get furt
her enlargement of the r
ecovery and growth in the economy, presumably creating additional funds
--yet I believe I heard you say that you are 
going to have a further slowing of the time and sa
vings deposits.  Now what am I missing, if the 
time [and savings deposits are] going slower
 and the demand [for them] is going slower. 
MR. AXILROD.  We™re not expecting--I was trying to explain the behavior of time and 
savings deposits recently.  In April, there were both
 special factors as well as
, I believe, shifts to demand deposits for spending purposes as well as 
direct use [of the original demand deposits] for 
spending purposes.  We™re actually
 projecting some pickup in the 
rate of growth of time and 
savings deposits, but not at a rate as fast as occurred in the first 
quarter.  A slower rate of growth, but a pickup from the pace of April-May. 
MR. COLDWELL.  [Does] your forecast for these various alternatives range no higher 
than 8 percent for M2 and go as low as 2-3/4 per cent, depending on the alternative selected? 
MR. AXILROD.  That™s right. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Now, that to me sounds lik
e you™re still slowing this time and savings 
[deposit] package.   
MR. AXILROD.  Well, we™re getting a very low growth rate in May because of the 
pattern.  We had a jump up in the beginning of Apr
il, it™s been very stable through the first week in May, and then we™re beginning to pick up the rate of growth in May.  But that gives us a very low growth rate in May as compared with April,
 and then you get a rather more normal growth 
rate appearing in June.  And so when you average the two months together, you do come out 
with a low growth rate for June, as a rather more normal growth rate for the time and savings 

deposits on the order of around 10 percent, whereas May is an abnormally low growth rate, on 
the order of around 5.  We are projecting a pickup.   MR. COLDWELL.  I won™t take any more of 
the Committee™s time Mr. Chairman.  I don™t 
quite understand the figures with what I™ve heard when you look at the forecast of the June rate on M2 at 6 percent.  But on the second sheet, page 6, on the alternatives [unintelligible]. 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, you see, that goes with
 a 1 percent M1, and so your time deposits 
would be on the order of 10 percent for another month. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  Mr. Partee next, please. MR. PARTEE.  I had two questions.  First, Mr. Sternlight, as you stated in your review, the adjustment in the market [to] the cha
nges in observed Federal Reserve policy was remarkably, extraordinarily smooth.  Would you say, Pe
ter, that it™s completed?  That is, would 
you say, since it was so smooth, is it 
still partial?  Or, say that the federal funds rate stayed in the 5.25 to 5.30 range, where it™s been trading--do you think the market adjustment was not-- 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think the adjustment to that 5.25 to 5.30 or-- 
5/17/77 - 20 - 
    MR. PARTEE.  --or 5.35-- MR. STERNLIGHT.  --area, or something like, has been completed. 

MR. PARTEE.  And that involved an increase in
 bills from about 4.40 to about 5 percent?   
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Thereabout, 4.50 to 5 percent. MR. PARTEE.  --4.50 to 5 percent.  Which br
ings me to my ques
tion to Mr. Axilrod.  Now this last 50 basis points in bills was really not a segment of the [interest] rate range 

competitive with thrift institutions and time a
nd savings deposits.  If you have another--and I 
guess this is sort of like Phil™s question--if you had another 50 basis point increase, it would be a much more sensitive increase wouldn™t it, from
 the standpoint of limiting growth in time and 
savings deposit forms?  I think you made that
 comment in the Bluebook, but you didn™t dwell on it in here, in your oral comment. MR. AXILROD.  Well, that™s essentially why, 
under alternative C, which assumes another 
50 basis point increase in the funds rate and approximately that in the bill 
rate, that we have a somewhat more substantial slowing in M2 than
 we would ordinarily have in comparing two 
alternatives.  And our thought was that you would force out a considerable amount of the hot 
money, in effect, that had been put in savings deposits as the rate gets significantly above the 
ceiling rates of 5 and 5-1/4 percent.  And a large part of that money would flow into Treasury securities.  Some of it might flow into large 
nonnegotiable CDs that would have no effect on M2, 
but some of it would also fall into Treasury secu
rities, so we would expect a more substantial 
one-time reaction in time deposits.
  MR. PARTEE.  And that could be even more
 so, I suppose, Steve, because we have a 
larger proportion in time and sa
vings deposit form now that are really sizable sums.  I happen to 
divide our categories in savings and time deposit
s between the consumer type and business or 
institutional type, and the consumer type has he
ld up very well through April.  The cumulative increase in consumer-type savings and small cer
tificates is at a 10.6 percent annual rate through April.  Whereas the other, the residual, that 
includes large nonnegotiable CDs and things like 
that, has dropped off from a 20-25 percent rate earlier to a cu
mulative of only 9 by April.  MR. AXILROD.  I might add, Gove
rnor Partee, if we are right and you don™t get an offset in some other components of time deposits, this
 effect I think would be temporary, and you would return later to a higher growth rate even at the higher level of interest rates because you would have just removed-- 
MR. PARTEE.  You have a stock adjustment. 

MR. AXILROD.  --you would have removed a st
ock of hot money; that™s what we are assuming.  So therefore, that™s why we suggested
 a 3/4 point drop in the alternative C range for M2 relative to alternative B, 
to accommodate that stock adjustment without having to make a 
policy move. 
MR. PARTEE.  And what that™s associated with is another increase in the complex of 
market rates of about 50 basis points. 
5/17/77 - 21 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  In effect, to moving the Trea
sury bill rates, obviously, well above the passbook ceiling rate.  On an investment yield basi
s, it™s above the commercial bank ceiling rate 
right now, of course. MR. PARTEE.  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All ri
ght.  Mr. Black, please. MR. BLACK.  I™d like to ask Mr. Sternlight--Peter, a couple of things impress me about 
the behavior of the financial markets since our la
st meeting.  One is that most rates, and long 
rates, of course, in practice have moved up less th
an the federal funds rate.  The other is, you™ve had some little strength in the stock market in the 
face of an increase in the prime rate.  And I™m 
wondering here, and this is a very hard question to answer, do you read into this any feeling on the part of the market that inflationary expecta
tions have diminished at least temporarily, [any] 
feeling of relief that we have provided evidence that we are moving to stem inflation? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think that some market participants 
would take some comfort in 
observing that the System has moved to counteract th
at burst of growth in the aggregates.  I don™t know if I™d want to go further than that, as to saying that inflationary expectations are significantly diminished, because the markets were
 also getting evidence through this period of 
continuing price increases. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  Mr. Eastburn now, please. MR. EASTBURN.  Steve, you mentioned that y
ou™ve revised your interest rate forecast upward.  One of the things that we have been doing regularly once a month is to look at the 
interest rate patterns to see what this tells us a
bout expectations and forecasts for interest rates on 
the part of the market.  And, with the exception of
 one month, the market pattern has consistently 
forecast lower interest rates than the Bluebook 
has expected.  Do you have any feeling about 
what that means?  The only thing that occurred 
to us was that the market may believe that we™re 
going to be more liberal with the aggregates 
than in fact we think we are going to be. MR. AXILROD.  Or the market may have a 
weaker economic forecast, more obviously.  
We do check our forecasts against what™s in the 
futures market, and what™s implicit in the yield 
structure--both.  And at the time we were maki
ng the forecast, the three-month bill rate in the 
futures market, by the first quarter of ™78, wa
s being forecast at 6-3/4 percent; by the second 
quarter, around 7.  And implicit in the yield structure, it was being forecast around 6-1/4 percent.  So you are about 1/2 to 1 point, roughly, below what
 we would expect a three-month bill rate to 
be at that time.  But I have no way of knowing 
whether it™s a weaker economic forecast, or a 
higher money growth forecast, or just sheer hunc
h.  I just literally 
couldn™t quantify that. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Have you ever gone back to 
check the accuracy of these two methods 
of-- MR. AXILROD.  No, I haven™t, but I™d say it was a good thing to do.  I think we will. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  Mr. Jackson now, please. 5/17/77 - 22 - 
    MR. JACKSON.  Steve, in view of your flow of funds projections and the general scenario painted in the Bluebook, what do you see the yield curve doing during this next six to nine months?  Is it going to get signif
icantly flatter, or are long-ter
m rates going to react upward, where you continue to have a significant disparate view between s
hort and long term?  Or what™s 
the general scenario you are expecting to pull out of all of this? MR. AXILROD.  I believe that if short rates go up over the next several months, roughly the order of magnitude that we proj
ected or a little less or a little more, that you™ll have not very 
large effects on long-term rates on average.  Any time that the short rate begins to move up, we™ll 
have an expectational effect, or just an adjustment effect, then it might ease off a little.  So I 

think the yield curve will follow something like 
the normal cyclical pattern, that it will tend to 
flatten.  And of course, in saying that, I™m ma
king an assumption that any tightening that 
develops will be of a kind that restrains inflation and not merely
 an increase in rates that is 
reflecting an inflation that is, as it were, pulling the rates up.  If you™re in that situation, then I think that long-term rates w
ould move up rather sharply.  
MR. JACKSON.  Does that tie in with the flow of funds projections that we™ve got?   
MR. KICHLINE.  Yes, they™re consistent.  We
 have a fairly easy corporate bond market.  
We™ve got a lot of institutional money around, 
and some drop-off in corporate bond market 
borrowing.  Our explicit forecast of a corporate bond 
rate is, by the end of this year, to the 8-1/2 
percent area, which is only up about 1/4 point, so you do have a substantial flattening in the yield curve as you go through the year. MR. AXILROD.  I would like to point out, Governor Jackson, because I think it™s a very 
critical point, that if you think back to ™74, while the yield curve flattened, there was a sharp tightening in the money market partly because of 
how sharp the rate of inflation became, and so 
you did get a very sharp rise in long-term rates at the same ti
me.  And I™m assuming that the 
restraint on the aggregates, if that develops, would be sufficient to keep the rate of inflation from 
accelerating significantly. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.
  Mr. Balles next, please. MR. BALLES.  Just a comment on the Board st
aff forecast, Steve, of M1 and M2.  My 
staff™s been keeping book on the accuracy of these things and found out something rather 
interesting, I think.  In the first place, we always 
filter out the noise in 
the week-to-week series, as you know, by using these 13-week moving averages, and we incorporate your forecast 
numbers into our moving average.  But for the firs
t quarter of this year, it was quite significant, 
we thought, that the accuracy of the M2 forecast th
at you have was considerably better than that 
for M1.  Specifically, for the first quarter, the aver
age error in the forecast 
of [the] M1 average is at about 1/4 percent [relative] to the actual level of the aggregates, but for M2, only 7/100 percent.  Now, so far, we haven™t gone back earlier than the first quarter of this year; perhaps you have.  I wonder if you would comment on any impr
essions you might have on the accuracy of 
these forecast numbers which, at least at the moment
, seem to indicate that
 a better job is doable on M2 and not M1. 5/17/77 - 23 - 
    MR. AXILROD.  No, I don™t have any good feeling of the last year.  And I think that we will go back and assess both our interest rate 
forecast in line with President Eastburn™s 
suggestion and our M1 and M2 forecast.  As you know, we reassess these things periodically and 
have normally found that there is somewhat less 
error in the M2 forecast because you do have 
some offsetting shifts between demand and time de
posits that help you, and it™s a larger number, 
in a sense.  If our error is, as you have noted, 1/4 percent on M1, it™s got to be the lowest in history. MR. BALLES.  That™s on a moving average.   
MR. AXILROD.  That™s why we would have-- 
MR. PARTEE.  And it didn™t include April. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question or comment?  Well, if not we still need to act 
on the activities carried out
 at the Domestic Desk.  Is there 
a motion to approve the transactions 
of the Desk. SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The motion has been ma
de and, I take it, approved.  We™re ready 
now to turn to monetary policy and our domestic po
licy directive.  I think in some ways our task 
today is an easy one, and in other ways it™s some
what puzzling.  I think our decision last month 
was certainly in the right direction, and I think it™s been carried out well at the Desk.  And we™re in a stronger position than we were a month ago.   But when I look at the several alternatives for M1 on page 5 of the Bluebook, I™m a little 
puzzled.  Take for example, the figures under alternative B.  Well, now, suppose that the rate of growth for the May-June interval of M1 was as low as 1 percent.  Then, to be consistent with that, as indicated in this tabular construction, the federal funds rate would need to be 4-3/4 percent.  I think it would be a great mistake to move down from 
the present level--which is, I 
think, a little closer to 5-3/8 than it is to 5-1/4--back to 4-3/4, if we had 1 percent [growth of M1].  I™d say the same if we had a figure of zero.
  I™d say the same if we had a figure of minus 1 
or minus 2.  At some point, I would stop saying 
this, but you see what I™m getting at.  We ought 
to be willing to tolerate an extremely low rate
 of growth over this two-month interval without 
having the federal funds rate d
ecline at all appreciably.   Now, that leads me to feel that the lower 
limit of the federal funds rate ought to be 5 
percent, or preferably 5-1/4 percent.  And that we might have
 a narrow range for the federal funds rate, say 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 percent--the Desk staying at the present level, and then moving to one direction or another within that narrow range, depending on how the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates develops.   Now as for the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates, I think I w
ould prefer the figures under alternative C more than the 
figures under alternative B.  Actually, the figures that I would suggest that the Committee consider
 are as follows:  zero to 4 percent for M1, 3 to 7 percent for M2, and perhaps 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 percent for the federal funds rate.  There may well be 
inconsistencies that we would need to consider, either through a special telegram from the 
5/17/77 - 24 - 
    Chairman or through a telephone conference.  Well,
 let™s hear from members of the Committee.  
Mr. Coldwell, please. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, you started 
taking my speech away.  I was going to 
suggest a 5 to 5-3/4 with a 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 midpoint, and 
5-3/8 happens to be the midpoint of 5 to 
5-3/4.  And I was with you until you started talki
ng about the aggregates.  At that point, I 
dropped off the list because I™m a little bit hesitant
 about some of the forecast on this.  I™d take 
the M1 forecast of 1 to 5.  I™d pref
er M2 of 4 to 8 because I suspect
 that we are going to get some 
reactions in this picture ahead. 
 I, too, am not willing to give 
up what we™ve already had, but I don™t believe I want to say that if the thing co
mes in at below zero, I™d be unwilling to lower the 
funds rate target.  We need to be flexible on both
 sides.  We reacted to a very high April.  You 
get a very low June, then I think we ought to 
have some reaction to that. But that kind of a 
construct sounds perhaps equally unbalanced to yours, where you took the alternative C and I took in effect, alternative A, to some
 extent, although I 
didn™t go that far. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  For purposes of clarification, I made some introductory comments 
first and then suggested some 
numerical specifications.  Taking 
my numerical specifications, you 
see--zero to 4 for M1, for example--if a negativ
e figure for M1 developed, and assuming that 
there was no counterindication arising from M2, then an inconsistency would emerge that would 
call for special action by the Committee.  All right,
 let™s hear from Mr. Willes first now, please.   
MR. WILLES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Last
 month--which, of course, was my first 
meeting--the Committee was very cautious in ap
proaching policy.  And I suspect that was, as you indicated, very prudent in light of the uncerta
inties that the Committee faced.  But I, for one 
at least, feel much less cautious
 today than I was inclined to feel last month.  Most of the 
uncertainty relating to the energy program seems to
 be uncertainty as to what would get passed 
rather than how much of an impact it would 
really have on business spending.  None of the businessmen in our District really are changing thei
r plans or have any inclination to change their plans.  The underlying economy is strong and seem
s to be getting stronger each time we look at 
the numbers, which raises again the threat of in
creased inflation.  The international situation would seem to call for a very 
careful management of the expa
nsion in the economy.  And I was 
interested in Paul Volcker™s comment about 
how do you change people™s willingness to grant large wage increases, and there has been a feeling that there™s nothing you can do about that.   But I guess I™m not persuaded.  In Philadelphia
, they™ve just had a very serious transit strike.  A statement made by city government at
 one point was, we™re ju
st not going to give you any more money.  They went out on strike for a 
long time and finally settled for no more money.  
And then the next group that came in to settle 
after that, settled at precisely the same rate.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that must have b
een [a matter] of financial stringency--we 
don™t have more money to give you.  Now, to the extent that business firms are in the same 

position, they can hold out also against large wage demands, but you need a little adversity to 
produce that result. MR. WILLES.  I think that™s ex
actly right.  And that™s my po
int.  I think if businessmen think that every time there is a little adversity, whet
her it™s an increase in 
the Social Security tax or something else, and we are going to bail 
them out with monetary policy, they™ve got no 5/17/77 - 25 - 
    inclination to stand up.  But I get the impression fr
om many that I™ve 
talked with that they think we are serious about combating inflation, and they think that™s very good.  They™re looking for that kind of support and strength in the actions that they are taking.   Well, given that, I would have a preference fo
r taking a fairly significant step toward moderation in the rates of growth in the aggregates.  And even though I™m currently trying to 
negotiate for a mortgage, and this is probably not in
 my self-interest, I woul
d not be at all averse to seeing interest rates increase.  I think the numbers that you have 
come up with in terms of the 
aggregates are certainly fine.  It would not disturb me if we ha
d negative growth in M1.  I guess the only concern I would have is whether--well, I don™t really understand, I guess, the way the Desk works.  The range 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, I wouldn™t be at all concerned to see it go up to 5-3/4, but I get the impression that you only 
use the upper portion of that range if the aggregates are growing more rapidly than these 
numbers would suggest and so on. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, if--let™s take, just for purposes of illustration, a range of 
growth of M1 of zero to 4. And let™s ignore the fact, for purposes of this illustration, that the Desk gives equal weight to M1 and M2.  Then, as 4 was approached, the Desk would be moving 
the federal funds rate toward the upper limit of 5-3/4. 
MR. WILLES.  I see, okay. 

MR. PARTEE.  Or vice versa if it™s toward zero. 
MR. WILLES.  All right, that™s 
a little different than my und
erstanding, and that helps.  I guess, if anything, I™d be inclined to go 5-1/4 to 6 just so the Desk did feel willing to move fairly aggressively on [the] interest rate.  The only other comment I woul
d make is that, in addition to 
these steps in terms of open market policy, I woul
d think that, fairly quickly, we might want to 
consider an increase in the discount rate, and 
I know our own board of directors is becoming 
increasing inclined to m
ove in that direction. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, Mr. Willes.  Mr. Eastburn now, please. 

MR. EASTBURN.  Well, I would agree essen
tially with the staff™
s projections on the economy, with the possibility that we will be seeing 
a slowdown in the latter part of this year.  
And as I indicated earlier, that might not be too u
ndesirable.  So I approach this session with two main points of view.  One is th
at we should be seeing adjustment
 toward our longer-range targets for the aggregates, and that requires a small in
crease for this two-month period.  Second, that 
unless unusual developments occur, the funds 
rate should not decline.  So I like your 
specifications, Mr. Chairman.  I think that I w
ould be reluctant to see a significant negative 
figure for the two-month period because, if May co
mes in at 5 percent, as now forecast, that 
would imply a significant decline for June.  And 
I™m not sure that I™d like to see a very large 
decline-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, you say it would imply a significant decline for June.  If May, I think our staff in that event would be re
vising the figure for June. Isn™t that correct? MR. AXILROD.  Yes, if May were coming in 
weaker, we would of course, begin writing down June right around that time, so that both mont
hs could in effect be quite weak.  Something 
5/17/77 - 26 - 
    like that.  There could be a large negative in May, even a small pl
us for June; you can™t tell quite how the pattern would come. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Well, all I™m saying, unle
ss I don™t understand what you™re saying, you have a zero or a significant negative figure for 
the two-month period--I th
ink [that] is a little 
risky, and this leads me a li
ttle bit to alternative B. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I expressed a personal at
titude, and that personal attitude was not 
translated into a numerical specifica
tion that I suggested to the Committee. 
MR. EASTBURN.  So I think the important thing is to have the funds rate reasonably stable and be prepared to move it up, if necessary. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Partee now, please. MR. PARTEE.  Well, two things
 restrain me from moving with anything like as much 
alacrity toward monetary tightness as Mark Willes 
suggests.  The first is that in addition to an inflation objective, we also have the objective of maintaining 
reasonable growth in the economy, 
and the growth rates that are being projected by the staff are not unreasonably high.  This quarter, and I agree that it will be a high quarter, 
is perhaps a little on the high side.  But after 
that, even with every considerable strength, as I mentioned before, in eac
h line of the projection, why we™re talking about a growth rate of around 6 percent or perhaps a shade below, which we need unless we are to accept this unemployment rate as a perman
ent thing.  And I think it™s too high, of course, to accept as a permanent thing.   
So I would argue that the economic situati
on, which calls for some trade-off between 
inflation and growth in the objectives, ought to restrain [us] from being 
too restrictive, Mark, until you clearly see a period of excessive growth developing.  The second thing, though, that 
restrains me a little bit is we ha
ve done this twice before.  We di
d it in the spring of ™75, and in fact the aggregates then came in quite weakly, 
and we eased off.  And we did it a year ago.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  What harm did we do? 

MR. PARTEE.  And the aggregates eased off.  But I would rather not go a long way in that direction until I felt fairly certain this time th
at the trend was really with us.  And I think it probably is, but then I thought it probably was a year ago, and so I don™t know that I™m much of 
a forecaster.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Do you think we did much 
harm, significant harm
, in ™75 or ™76?  
You know, we reversed rather quickly. MR. PARTEE.  No, I don™t think we did, becau
se we did reverse, but I think it™s 
something I would prefer not to do if I didn™t-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Oh, in other words, you prefer not to make a mistake. 
MR. PARTEE.  But in any event, you know, we only have one high month--now, it™s an 
awfully high month. 
5/17/77 - 27 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Sure is.   
MR. PARTEE.  But on the other hand, there could well be a negative, which isn™t really projected in the May-June period, because if one is to use that as a sort of a stock adjustment in 
money supply, it may have been overdone.  And it 
may not turn downward.  So I think we ought 
to be a little cautious for another month or tw
o about going gung-ho toward increased tightness.  The Chairman™s suggestion of zero to 4 for the M1 range I think is appropriate.  According to my figures, if the midpoints of the staff™s alternat
ive B projection were realized, the December-to-June increase in the narrow mone
y supply would be 6-1/2, which is 
right at the very top of our range.  And cutting that just a little bit would ma
ke me a bit more comfortable, so I think zero to 
4, which I think may well be where we™ll 
be in May and June, is reasonable.   On M2, I think I would go Governor Coldwell™s way and say, well, M2 hasn™t been all that strong, and therefore we can afford to accept wi
thout real concern, say, a 4 to 8, which would 
mean that the December-to-June growth would be 
at the midpoint of our 
range or even a little 
below, if we fell in that range.  So that in case there is a snapback in 
time deposits, and I think 
it™s possible, I wouldn™t want to see us tighten if it were in that mode
st range of 4 to 8 percent.   And on the funds rate, I would, as I suggested earlier, argue that the next half [percentage point] is more important than the last half percen
t[age point] movement in the rate, and so I think 
we ought to be fairly cautious.  But a 5 to 5-3/4 strikes me as being a good range, with a 1/4 to a 
3/8 midpoint range, which, as I understand it, is 
about where we are--we™re probably a little above a quarter, so we™re probably not quite at 3/8.  And so a 1/4 to 3/8 is about a characterization of current condition.   But unless we continue to get unusual growth in the aggregates, which we may, I don™t feel 
I™d want to make a really major move in our pos
ture, and so it™s only in that case, which would call for a special wire, that I would want to see [us] go above 5-
3/4 in this next--I guess it™s a five-week interval before the next meeting, is that right?  It is a 
five-week interval, so we have a little longer time to make.  But it may call for a 
wire, but I would want to stop and consider 
before we went above 5-3/4. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I would certainly join you in considering pretty carefully.  Mr. Jackson, please, now. MR. JACKSON.  I would share a lot of the judgments that have been expressed about the concern for an unusual rate of growth, but I also am concerned about the uncertainty of the 
reaction that might flow fr
om that.  I wouldn™t want 
to hesitate to restrain that rate of growth if 
it™s quite clear that, in the period ahead, this growth has some underlying fundamentals to it.  But 
at the same time, I think it would be a mistake to 
try to react to it too seve
rely when it could be seasonals and everything else that
 would distort the course of policy.  I would prefer that we do so with a slightly different technique.  Of course, the one alternative w
ould be to use the money 
market approach, but I think that™s a mistak
e under the circumstances, with the underlying 
economic conditions developing the way they are.   
I think perhaps a better way, in my judgment, w
ould be to intentionally broaden the ranges.  More specifically, zero to 5 [for M1], 3 to 8 [for M2], which would give us the flexibility of 5/17/77 - 28 - 
    recognizing that we may have some reaction within 
a range.  But at the same time, it would give 
us the capacity--without 
having to have any special meeting or anything of that sort if the 
aggregates were clearly way below any expectat
ion or the strength continued--to react and go ahead and move to it with a 5 to 5-3/4 percent federal funds range and the same midpoints of 
5-1/4 to 5-3/8 we talked about.  But it strikes me that this ma
y be an easier operating method of 
approaching the same goal that™s
 been expressed by all of us. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Black now, please. MR. BLACK.  Our work with the aggregates tends to pretty well confirm the staff™s guess 
as to where these would come out for the sec
ond quarter, around 9 percent on M1, which is well above our long-run target rates.  But at the same time, as Gove
rnor Partee has pointed out, we ought to be careful to note that, historically, the second quarter in the last couple of years has been rather strong, and the third quarter has been somewhat weak. 
 And I think we ought to take that into consideration in reaching our decision 
today.  And I think it™s also worth noting that, 
while M1 has accelerated pretty sharply in the current quarter, M2 is moving less rapidly and 
may move even less rapidly than that in the future.   
And in view of all of this and our having moved the fed funds rate up by over 50 [basis 
points] fairly quickly , I would be inclined to stay about where we are at present.  And I would buy your specifications, Mr. Chairma
n, and the monetary aggregates directive.  But I think we ought to be quite prepared to use the latitude in the federal funds range if the aggregates in fact do tend to come in higher than we are estimati
ng.  I think the economy is quite strong.  I would 
not be surprised to see more strength than 
some of my colleagues think will be there. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Black.  Mr. Morris now, please. MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, could I cl
arify your proposal?  Do I understand you properly that you keep the funds rate at around 5-1/4 and only move it up if we were hitting the 
higher part of the ranges? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I would use the federal funds rate range in the normal fashion, 
and the federal funds rate now is closer to 5-3/8 than it is to 5-1/4--that™s my understanding.  And I would leave it where it is for a week or so, and then depending on how our estimates of the 
monetary aggregates come in, m
ove within the indicated range. 
 But the [center point of the] indicated range that I suggested is asymmetrical. 
MR. MORRIS.  Well, I think that my feeling, 
Mr. Chairman, is that we ought to make a 
bigger move right now.  I think the economy is very
 strong.  I think the lull that Mr. Partee and Mr. Eastburn speak of is certainly a possibility, but I don™t see in the indicators any evidence that it™s probable.  We are faced with this April bulge
 in the money supply, which means that even if 
the staff™s projections are correct for May and June, that we are going to come out with a very 
high M1 number.  And in order to meet the midp
oint of our longer-term ra
nges, this would mean 
M1 growth at 4 percent and M2 at 6.8 for the subsequent three quarters, and that, gentlemen, if 
our forecast is correct, is going 
to be very difficult to do.   
It seems to me that we need to take out 
some insurance today against the May and June 
aggregates coming in higher.  And therefore, I 
would propose a funds range of 5 to 6 percent, 
5/17/77 - 29 - 
    with the Manager instructed to move to 5-1/2 ne
xt week.  Now, unlike Mr. Partee, I don™t view the spring of 1975 experience as a mistake.  It seems 
to me that that™s sort of the model that we 
ought to be thinking of in this kind of context. 
 Because it seems to me that the move we made 
for the spring of 1975--because it was reversed rapi
dly as the evidence came in showing that we 
didn™t have a permanent increase in the demand 
for money--we didn™t harm the economy.  But if 
we had been right, and there was a big increase in the demand for money, we would have been in 
a much better posture to meet it, and-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would go even further to say that the fact that we moved that 
early in 1975 gave reassurance to the business and financial community. MR. MORRIS.  Well, it seems to
 me that, again, it is a matte
r of taking out insurance [in 
case the] second quarter bulge turns out to be bigger than we are now projecting.  But I think we ought to make another move, and I™m just talkin
g about a modest initial move next week, to 5-1/2 [and] give the Manager authority to move as high as 6 if the numbers come in on the high 
side.  It is not often, Mr. Chairman, [that] I™m on your right. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Morris.  Mr. Balles now, please. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, I find a great de
al of merit in your proposal, both for the 
reasons that you cited in your comments and because of the consider
ations in the longer term, as 
you set forth in your recent testimony on moneta
ry policy.  But looking upon other things, the 
fact [is] that, if anything, we have probably been a little too stimulative in the past.  As you all know, we™ve had some quite signifi
cant increases in the aggregates in 1976.  M1 over 6 percent, and M2 almost an 11 percent annual rate, and I can™
t believe the full effect of that has yet pulled through the economy.  Aside from the real es
tate speculation in California and possibly elsewhere, I was not one of the worriers today about the general economy.  I consider it to be 
quite strong for the balance of the year.  And I think my principal concern is
 that the longevity of this expansion may in fact be threatened by th
e strong inflationary tones we saw in the first 
quarter of this year, only a part of which I think is temporary.   
I find it interesting to look back to, say, the January Greenbook and see the increases in the staff™s forecasts for real GNP and inflation that
 have occurred since that time despite the 
withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus by the Admini
stration.  And, if I can get in a plug for some 
recent research work we™ve been doing, I think th
is upward revision might have been anticipated 
if we had paid more attention to what™s been goi
ng on in M2.  That is to say, this recent paper I have circulated to all of you suggests that M2 is presently, and has been since early 1975, a better predictor of income growth and 
of future price developments than has M1.  And we don™t see 
any signs of M2 growth slowing significantly.  The first half of 1977 looks to us like it™s going to increase at about a 10-1/2 percent annual rate.   As far as the M1 figure is concerned, I think we need to keep reminding ourselves of the 
work that Messrs. Axilrod and Paulus have done in their memorandum of last November 
suggesting, in effect, that M1 growth was really understated by all these financial market 
innovations by about 2 percent and perhaps another 1-1/4 percent this year.  It suggested that the true growth of M1, if it had not been subject to these changes, would have been more like a 7-1/2 
percent [rate].   
5/17/77 - 30 - 
    In short, I™m of the opinion that we have been
 overly generous.  I concur with you on that point in our past policy.  So that net-net, I believe it would be a mistake to let the federal funds 
decline right now, and if anything, [we] can move 
it up in a cautious manne
r rather than let it go down, with a view to keeping the aggregates under control, keepi
ng them within our ranges, and giving allowance to the fact th
at there are long lags, as you know, between the aggregates and the effect on prices.  And I think there was quite a bit of stimulus in 1976 and so far in 1977.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Balles.  Mr. Winn now, please. 
MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, I™d like to associat
e myself with the de
scription provided by Chuck in what we should be doing.  The demand fo
r credit, particularly for the large commercial and industrial borrower, is the thing that gives me pause at the moment.  I guess if we hadn™t had 
our blip in the money supply, we™d 
have been closer to a cut in 
the prime than the increase that 
occurred.  And the uncertainty with respect to future demand gi
ves me pause about the outlook.  
And in terms of the way we™ve had to revise 
our numbers, looking bac
k, the blip may not be 
quite the blip that we think it is.  Yet, at the moment, I would tend to say, steady as you go.  If 
the numbers come in again adversely, I™d be prepared to move upward, but until we have a little 

more confidence, I™d be inclined to hold as Chuck suggested.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Winn.  Mr. Kimbrel now, please. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Mr. Chairman, it isn™t often that
 our view in the deep South coincides so 
much with New England, but this morning I™m ve
ry close to Mr. Morris.  We™ve done a little 
more than our usual checking on attitudes and relationships with businessmen in the last couple 
of weeks.  And we find them ebullient.  We 
find the expectation [for] the economy strong and 
likely to continue, including the New Orleans area for investment 
and retail trade.  Our Florida 
friends are almost completely overlooking the 
weather-induced difficulty [with the] citrus 
[crop]--[they] almost think that it was an act 
of providence [because of] our overproduction.  
MR. PARTEE.  It keeps the price up. 
MR. KIMBREL.  Right, right.  The vegetable people have already come along with a crop 
to regain [unintelligible].  Flowers and housepla
nt people are full speed ahead, so they are very 
happy.  Tourist [offices] admitted that the studies 
they are making with relation to gasoline are 
not very scientific, but they are [saying] that 
[it] would take a dollar a gallon to very much 
[reduce] tourist activity in Florida.   Well, moving [from] that to the possibility that
 the minimum wage is going to be raised,  I 
have come [to] the very strong 
feeling that business leaders are confidently expecting that the system is going to lean against inflationary pr
essures that are building.  Frankly, I think we 
should, and I concur on that view and that we should continue to do so gradually.  If I had any difference of view with the numbers you™ve spec
ified, I would take 5-1/4 to 6 percent on the federal funds rate and use it.  We™ve stuck for 
some months and then gradually moved since our 
last meeting, so I think the market
 really is about ready to accept this restraint.  I™d accept the other numbers you™ve assigned under an aggregates objective. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Kimbrel.  Mr. Wallich now, please. 
5/17/77 - 31 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  I am one of those who worri
ed about the economy, but more because I 
didn™t understand what was going on than becau
se I had a negative forecast.  Now I am 
impressed by the very peculiar behavior of the a
ggregates.  I think this may be a time where one 
might contemplate a money market directive. 
 I think that no matter what happens to the 
aggregates in the immediate future, the second qu
arter and even the first half will look like a 
period of very high monetary expansion, and I w
ould like to hold that down while at the same 
time not relying too much [on] what one can 
guess [about] which way the aggregates are going to move from here.   
So I would go with Philip Jackson and widen the aggregates range.  My preference there 
would be to allow even a negative number in M1, negative 1 to 4; and on M2, 2 to 7.  Now the funds rate--I am impressed by the fact that, according not only to our own forecast but even to 

Otto Eckstein, we have got to go up 150 basis points or so by the end of the year.  We have taken 
one bite right now, but there are three more bites [of] that si
ze ahead.  I think we cannot-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That is, ahead according to Otto Eckstein. 
MR. WALLICH.  Well, that™s a 
hint according to Otto Eckstein; then more may be ahead 
according to-- 
MR. PARTEE.  Is that 150 from here, Henry? 

MR. WALLICH.  From here to 
6-3/4 or 7.  But we™ve three mo
re bites of the size that we have taken just now.  Each time will take a great 
effort of will on our part to steel ourselves for 
that.  And given that the aggregates behavior right now has been helping us and justifies the 
appearance of a further move, I™d go to a 5-1/4 to 6 on the funds rate and move slowly, not immediately, to the midpoint of that range.  
And as I say, I™d be open to a money market 
directive on that if there is some sp
irit for that from the Committee.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Gardner now, please. 

MR. GARDNER.  Gentlemen, I have been listeni
ng to a great deal of wisdom.  I guess we 
all know who we are today.  I think originally, until I heard the Chairman™s suggestion, 
[unintelligible] I asked myself, in view of the buoyancy of the economic indicators, what would 
we be doing if we hadn™t had a 19 percent growth in M1 in April?  I suspect we wouldn™t be 
quite as aggressive in raising rates as some of our colleagues are 
proposing.  So if we look at the alternates involving quite constraining M1 and M2 ranges and, on the other hand, a fairly narrow 
and modest proposal on the funds rate, I think this 
has some advantage.  If we can achieve what 
the staff forecasts and [eliminate] the very dram
atic bulge in M1 in April through passage of time, we™ll have present market rates already 
up and [a] willingness to go up half a bite, Henry, 
in our range for the federal funds proposal.   It seems to me that incorporated in this re
duction in the aggregates 
ranges and retaining or narrowing the federal funds range, we have a comp
romise that makes a good deal of sense to me 
because there [were] a great number of queries 
expressed about the future of the economy.  
We™ve put a lot of attention on automobiles.  The auto business falls apart in the middle of the 
year, as we all know.  It may fall apart further th
is year because of the incipient energy program 
5/17/77 - 32 - 
    that might change the mix significantly.  I™m qu
ite happy with this alternate suggestion, although I haven™t heard it before because I 
think it™s a balanced suggestion. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Gardner.  Mr. Lilly now, please. MR. LILLY.  Well, I™m glad to be almost at th
e last because, as the meeting started out, I 
had kind of a sense of dismay about whether I was 
going to be able to voice my theory.  But then 
Frank spoke up, and now I have somebody to speak against.  Thank you, Frank.  We have moved 

70 to 80 basis points since last January, depending on how you figure it.  It™s 72 to 84 basis points, and I think that™s a rather significant movement, particular
ly when it takes us right back to where we were [in] June a year ago.  And my
 feeling is that we ought to look for some lag 
effects and make sure that we haven™t move
d too rapidly before we go any further.   And I, therefore, think this:  I don™t find that there™s a great deal of
 difference between any of what I™ve heard, and I would associate myself 
with Chuck™s position just because of a little 
more flexibility.  And that™s zero to 4 [for M1], 5 to 8 [for M2], and the 5 to 5-3/4 [for the federal funds rate] with the midpoint--one of those w
onderful things that this Committee decides a 
midpoint is--another rang
e, 5-1/4 to 5-3/8. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, thank 
you, Mr. Lilly.  Mr. Mayo now, please.  
MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, as a preamble to 
my remarks, I should report an observation 
coming out of my recent brief vacation in Greece. 
 I decided that, despite my confidence in the 
staff projections and in the ability of this Committee to do a good job, 
I™d like to consult the independent sorts of wisdom, so I spoke with th
e Oracle at Delphi about monetary policy.  The Oracle is strangely silent about M1 and M2.  The Oracle gave me the impression that these 
things had to be viewed in longer[-run] terms, and one shouldn™t
 be too concerned with things that are happening right at the moment.   
The Oracle in effect then suggested that I look around me and make 
my own observations.  
I observed that Greece at this time of
 the year was very green.  It was raining when I was there.  I interpreted this as the Oracle telling me that we 
did have, indeed, at least plenty of liquidity in the country and maybe too much.  I also observe
d around me the ruins of half a dozen treasures 
of the city states of Greece.  I 
noticed that the treasury of Athens still had its walls intact, but the 
roof had fallen in.  I took this to mean that 
we, too, should be concerned about the affairs of the Treasury.   To get back from Greek mythology--the Orac
le was often wrong on substance--I find your prescription quite appropriate today, Mr. Chairman.  I wouldn™t 
object to going to the zero to 5 on M1, or the 3 to 8 on M2.  I feel that, indeed, looking at this in a little longer perspective, we™ve had this increase in M1.  I suspect that this may be a place for a pause in our movement 

upward, which I think may proceed over a period 
of time here.  But I would prefer going along 
with the 5 to 5-3/4 percent range in the money ma
rket directive.  I think the 5-3/8 is a suitable midpoint at this time.  I have as a side issue a li
ttle concern that if we start paying more attention 
to M2--I™m not disputing Mr. Balles™s 
analysis, I think it is a very good one--[but]
 we may find 
that we are giving ourselves too much stimulatio
n in terms of over-relia
nce on a target of M2; 5/17/77 - 33 - 
    [it] may mislead us with regard 
to M1, to which the market, for better or for worse, still pays 
most attention. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Volcker now, please. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I™m 
afraid New York is not to be confused with Athens, 
although I sometimes think the roof is falling in. 
 Everything that I could have said has already been said in one way or another.  Let me just say in terms of 
the business situation, where I think 
that a fair number of uncertainties could develop later this year and into
 next year--but that™s always the case--I do think there™s a lot of buoyancy now, and as I add up the business and inflationary situation, we may be better off to
 meet these uncertainties later in the year by 
moving a bit now.  And I think it would be reassuring psychologically and otherwise.   I think the aggregates have certainly been rising too rapidly.  This April figure puts the frosting on the cake in a big way, but they were rising somewhat too rapidly before.  And when I 
look at this pattern projecting ahead, with all the uncertainties that it has, it brings the aggregates down within the targets, but it does it with a lot of 
interest rate increases later in the year that I™m 
not sure I would like to see, given the uncertainties that exist.  We™ve also gotten by with an 
adjustment so far with very little disturbance in 
the market.  And I think I™
d like to press that luck 
a little further.  This may be a better time to do 
it, with the market in good technical shape, than 
some subsequent time.   
So in terms of the actual specifications, I 
had the same numbers in mind that you cited 
about an hour ago, that if the range was widened at all, and I some
times think it™s useful to widen 
the range.  I must say I would lower it.  I™d put negative 1 to 4 [for M1], as Henry Wallich 
suggested, and 2 to 7 [on M2], if I was going to m
ove in any direction.  It wouldn™t disturb me at 
all to see zero or a slight minus figure in this
 particular period against the background that we have.  I would be content with zero to 4, 3 to 7.   I also think the federal funds range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 is a good one.  I™d want to stop and pause before going above 5-3/4.  But given the wa
y I feel about the aggregates, I™m not very 
eager to see the funds rate being reduced if we were plus 1 or 2 percent on M1 or equivalent figures on M2, so that [a midpoint anywhere fr
om] 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 strikes me quite nicely.  I 
suppose I would be a little cautious after what we
 have just done and like to consider the midpoint something like 5-3/8 or 1/2, implying 
a pretty modest move at the moment.  But 
anything from 5-1/4 to 5-1/2, whether we consider it fully symmetrically or a bit biased at least 
in not moving too rapidly to 
5-1/2, is fine with me.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, as mentioned 
earlier, it seems to me
 I see indications 
of a spreading speculative inclination in the ec
onomy, and while competitive efforts of extenders 
of credit to put out funds probably don™t guarantee speculation--   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I am having a littl
e difficulty hearing you, Mr. Baughman.  
MR. BAUGHMAN.  It seems to me that the comp
etitive efforts of lenders to put out funds don™t guarantee speculation, but they do nevertheless provide an environment in which it can be 
5/17/77 - 34 - 
    continued and spread.  And so it seems to me that we™re at a poi
nt where we should be pretty sure we don™t add further to liquidity in the economy and [therefore we should] possibly tighten 
up just a little.  It™s in that context that your specification has great appeal to me.  It seems to me 
that it just does the job about right--starting with the present market rate on fed funds and with 
the intention not to move below that, and if we see 
the substantial growth rate
 in either M1 or M2 move up from that level.  And it seems to me that™s appropriate.   
I would make one other kind of gratuitous obs
ervation, and that is, with the proposed well-head tax on petroleum products, that it would be
 appropriate to start [feeding] into the conversation at the Washington level, if possible, 
that those funds, if collected, not be collected [to] be fed back into the economy into the hands
 of petroleum users but rather be funds used either for the purpose of reducing the federal deficit or for being available for some kind of 
reduction in tax rates.  And the experience with re
spect to the $50 rebate just might have set the 
stage for some such operation being effective also.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Mr. Guffey, we haven™t heard from you yet. MR. GUFFEY.  Mr. Chairman, waiting until or 
near the end to speak should be of some 
help, but it is not to me this morning because 
I had an underlying philosophy or feeling to want 
to take a bite against inflation.  But I™m also trou
bled by the fact that we have received a rather 
substantial surprise in April.  And there is not 
a great deal of uncertainty
 toward May or June.  And as a result, I™m attracted to a proposal es
sentially made by Governor
 Partee, that is the 
aggregates, zero to 4 [for M1], 4 to 8 for M2, but I would also adopt your proposal for the funds rate, with some restraint on the Desk to move fr
om the current level until we get fairly near the 
upper bounds of those ranges.  And as the result, I think it would be appropriate to adopt the money market conditions directive, 
with that type of restriction.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  And we will hear from you, Mr. Roos. 
MR. ROOS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We feel 
a greater concern of danger at the upside than we do at the downside.  I personally don™t share the concern that ha
s been expressed this morning that there could be a slight slackening in the rate of in the recovery.  I think if the 
recovery continues to move ahead at its present rate over a prolonged period of time, we™d have a 
greater problem than if there were 
a moderate slackening of that.   Specifically, I would subscribe to the Chairman™s ranges for M1 and M2.  Philosophically and for other reasons, I resist a narrowing of the funds range, and I would prefer to see 5-1/4 to 6 percent.  We don™t have to use the 6 percent, 
but it™s there.  We have a--probably isn™t too 
relevant--but we have a large cemetery in St. Lo
uis, Mr. Chairman, which I passed on the way to 
the airport, which advertises its 
plots by saying it is better to have and not need than to need and not have, and if there is a need to go to 6 percent, maybe 
it™s better [that it] be there. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I™d like to pick up where you left off and say a word about cemeteries.  I think cemeteries should be used more
 extensively than they are.  They could serve a novel purpose, namely to bury economic forecast
s.  Now where we were about three months 
ago or so, and the Administration came forward w
ith a fiscal package, the Administration made 
5/17/77 - 35 - 
    its forecast for the economy.  Well, since the
n, the President has wit
hdrawn his recommendation for a rebate, and federal expenditures are $10 billion lower than had been estimated, and the 
economy is now just about where the estimators t
hought it might be at the end of the year.   
Now all this proves that we™ve put so much 
emphasis on changes in fiscal and monetary 
policies, and we tend still to ignore the great momentum that our private economy is capable of 
carrying through on its own.  And I think this has a 
bearing on today™s discussion.  I still have to 
review the sentiments and the views expressed by 
members of the Committee, but as I listened to 
members of the Committee, I thought we were a
ll saying pretty much the same thing.  But I 
guess there were differences.  The differences were all over the lot.  But the differences were 
within an extremely narrow range
 and a range that is of no significance at all relative to the 
errors that we keep on making and that we don™t know how to improve upon.  And now, if you 
will just forgive me, I want to study these 
minutiae and give my best report on it.  
MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, while you ar
e studying that, may I ask Mr. Kimbrel a 
question?  In discussing the Florida freeze, you 
mentioned that you thought it might have been 
an act of providence.  We are aware that certain of your townspeople are now running the United States government, but I didn™t know 
they had taken over the weather. MR. KIMBREL.  I hope they do a better job of that than they do some other things. 
MR. PARTEE.  Is there anybody left in Atlanta? 
MR. KIMBREL.  Really got our share of-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  They certainly loaded the 
airplanes to Atlanta from Washington every 
Friday night. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, I could take
 a great deal of your time and my time 
summarizing these figures, and, if you will perm
it me, I will not do that but simply make a 
suggestion to the Committee that I think comes cl
ose to summarizing the central tendency of the 
Committee™s thinking.  I would suggest we vot
e on the following:  A monetary aggregates 
directive on an M1 range of zero to 4, on an M2 range of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, on a federal funds rate range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 with the midpoint of 5-3/
8, a figure that is to be approached within the next few days--the Desk is very close to it.   That is my suggestion to the Committee.  I 
think it expresses the tendency of the narrow ranges within the Committee™s thinking during this
 3-1/2 hour meeting.  Are there any questions 
or comments? 
SPEAKER(?).  Could we take a vote
