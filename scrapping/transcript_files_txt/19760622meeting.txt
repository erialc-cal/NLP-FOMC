June 22, 1976 [Executive session] 
 
 CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, we have a 
special meeting, and our
 newest Governor David Lilly, I am glad to say, has joined us this morning.  
MR. LILLY.  There are many old familiar faces ar
ound this table.  I™m glad to be with you 
all again. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I might have said that, 
yes.  Newest Governor, but an old Federal Reserve hand.   As members of the Committee have been info
rmed, Henry Reuss has filed a suit against our individual District Banks and individual Bank Presidents.  And I™ve asked Mr. Broida to make copies of Mr. Reuss™s letter along with th
e civil action that he™s brought and asked that it be made available to the Comm
ittee.  I™ve written a brief note of acknowledgment merely saying 
that I received his letter and 
that I will make sure that memb
ers of the Committee are properly 
informed.  Now, I™ve asked Tom O™Connell, our couns
el, to tell us whatever he may be prepared 
to say about this lawsuit.  Mr. O™Connell.   MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  As an ad
ministrative matter you might wish to 
note that, on comments [to the press]--  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I might just say one word
 I have very much on my mind.  We have 
had numerous inquiries from the press, and I™ve gi
ven strict directions to Mr. O™Connell not to comment in any way, and that is precisely what
 I™m going to do if anyone asks my view--I will 
say I have no comment.  And I hope that each
 of you will do exactly the same.  No good can 
come from a [public] discussion of
 this lawsuit.  Mr. O™Connell. MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, I checked with the courthouse this morning.  This civil 
action number is 76-1142.  The case has been as
signed to Judge Barrington Parker, who is the United States District Court Judge for the District of Columbia.   
The complaint, of course, asks that a thre
e-judge court be appointed for the purpose of determining a constitutional issue [raised] by 
the complaint.  Mr. Reuss has challenged the 
provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, section 12A, which is the provision containing the constitution of the Committee.  He asserts that this
 is in violation of the  [U.S.] Constitution and 
the provision there in article II , section 2, clause 2, which is the so-called appointments clause, 
[which] provides basically that officers of the United States be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.   Mr. Reuss charges that the members designate
d as defendants--and as the Chairman said, 
each Federal Reserve Bank President has been th
us designated, or his alternate serving on the 
Committee at this time--the five members and thei
r alternates as well as each Reserve Bank--are 
in every respect, insofar as they operate on this
 Committee, officers of the United States because 
6/22/76 - 2 - 
    of the import of their function a
nd the impact of the actions of 
this Committee, and thus they 
should be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.   
He therefore, asks in his [unintelligible] that the member
s of the Committee be enjoined 
from functioning as members of the Committee and, 
secondly, that any action that is directed at the Reserve Bank of New York, namely the Desk, in
sofar as that action [was] participated in by any of the Reserve Bank Presidents, be enjoined.  And he asks that the portion of section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act designating appointment be declared 
unconstitutional, and for such other and further relief as the court deems appropriate.   
One final point, if I may, Mr. Chairman.  There 
are several issues that
 we are going to have to explore very carefully.  Among them, preliminar
ily, will be the standing of this plaintiff to 
bring this lawsuit.  I think there is a significant qu
estion as to his standing to bring this suit.  He bases his alleged standing on one 
of two pieces.  One, that he is
 a member of Congress and as a 
member of Congress, as assigned by statute, has 
certain responsibilities.  He is prevented from 
carrying out these responsibilities insofar as they relate to
 oversight of monetary policy 
formulation, credit regulation, the 
issuance of currency, etc.--that he is being deprived of this right as a member of Congress.
  He assigns identification in the complaint to himself as 
chairman, of course, of [his congressional] committee,
 but he doesn™t particularly assert that role in the complaint.   
In the alternative, he identifies himself as 
an individual who is the owner of government obligations, having a value in excess of $20,000, and that the acti
on [of the FOMC], insofar as 
it™s participated in by the Presidents named as 
defendants, jeopardizes that ownership, and he thus asks that their further action be enjoined.  Mr. Chairman, without taking the time to give you 
the basis for the question of standing, I think it is 
an issue that we will hopefully [unintelligible] 
explore.   Quite apart from that are the constitutional i
ssues that have been raised, among them a 
consideration of whether or not the Board of Governors as such is head of a department within 
the meaning of article II.  Namely, if the Bo
ard is head of a department, its function in 
approving, as required by law, the appointment of
 the [Reserve Bank] Presidents designated to [serve on] this Committee may well meet [the requireme
nts of] article II.  This is an issue that we 
will be exploring with the Department of Justice.
  I contacted them last night, Mr. Chairman, and 
we gave them copies of the complaint this morning.   
I was served this morning by the United Stat
es Marshall, with copies for each of the Presidents named as defendants.  I raised no ques
tion of the service process.  There could have been a technical question as to whether or not 
they can effect service on corporate Reserve Banks 
in the city.  But certainly he, the Marshall, would have come into th
e [Board Room] without permission and served each defendant.  So I accep
ted service on the part of the defendants, Mr. Chairman, but it does not preclude us fr
om raising technical points later.   
At this point, the Department [of Justice] 
is taking no position.  All of the issues I™ve 
mentioned will be explored thoroughly.  I believe the complaint gives the Committee members 

20 days within which to respond.  This has a technical meaning.  Under the law, officers of the 
United States or officials of the United States government have 60 days within which to respond 
6/22/76 - 3 - 
    to a complaint filed in federal district court.  
Having been assigned 20 days on the complaint, it™s 
clear that the plaintiff™s position is that the defe
ndants named are not officials or officers of the 
United States, even though the complaint sa
ys they should be so determined.   
The petition for a three-judge court is, in the first instance, before Judge Parker.  As a technical matter, it™s possible that we will attempt,
 after further consultation with the Department 
[of Justice] and the advice of this Committee, to file a motion to dismiss this complaint for lack 

of standing.  [If it] were to be filed timely, [
it would] perhaps disenable the Federal District Court Judge from certifying the case to the chief judge
 at the Court of Appeals.  It is the chief judge who assigns two District Court Judges, including Judge Parker, [who, along with] a Court 
of Appeals judge, constitute the three-judge constitutional court that is called to decide these issues.  Mr. Chairman, I think that
™s all the information I have.  I™ll be glad to respond to any 
questions you may have.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you very much.  
Now, gentlemen, just one question.  Our 
12 Bank Presidents are going to be sued.  They will need counsel.  Will you serve as counsel 

along with some members of the Justice De
partment, or do you have enough to use? MR. O™CONNELL.  At this point, Mr. Chairman, I woul
d interpret this lawsuit against the 
individuals named as in reality constituting a su
it against a portion of the FOMC, and with your approval, I think it appropriate that I represent these individuals, 
if that™s satisfactory, together 
with counsel from the Justice Department.  And 
we have asked [the Justice Department] for the 
assignment of a specific individual who has worked on a number of constitutional law questions 

under article II.  They hope to provide a specialist in this area to be of assistance.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Any questions?   

VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We could have counsel of our own, Mr. Chairman, and I 
would hope that they would be involved in this process. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let me say a word a
bout that.  Fortunately, of course, each of you has counsel of his own.  And, of course, th
e opinions of your counsel should be transmitted, 
but this must not be regarded as a suit that is 
brought against anyone of you as an individual.  It™s a lawsuit that is really brought against the fuller
 concept of the Federal Open Market Committee.  
And therefore, a single unified legal defense, I take it, is essential.  To draw upon the best legal ability that we can--that we do have--is only good sense.  But I think it would be clearly wrong 
for individual members of this Committee to go o
ff in individual directions.  This must be a 
single unified legal approach, at least that™s the way it appears to me. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  May I say, Mr. Chairman, that Pres
ident Volcker™s general counsel is 
also associate general counsel of this Committee, 
and because of that reason, I spoke at length on 
the phone with him last night to apprise hi
m of the lawsuit and 
its basic character. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Good.  
MR. MACLAURY.  I was going to ask, Mr. Chairman, if
 Tom could tell us anything about the case cited in the covering lett
er, of Buckley v. Valeo, or whether that™s even worth taking the time to do now. 
6/22/76 - 4 - 
    MR. O™CONNELL.  I™d be glad to briefly comment, Mr. Chairman, if I may.  Buckley v. 
Valeo is a suit that was decided in January of this year, and of course most recently has been 
cited as precedent for upsetting the [1974 Federa
l Election Commission act].  That statute was 
brought into question by the plaintiffs, [among whom] were c
ongressional members and so-
called political appointees, who had brought suit [in Buckley v. Valeo in January 1975] to have the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended in 1974, declared invalid for a number 
of reasons. Pertinent to [the Reuss] lawsuit is the 
portion of the [Buckley v. Valeo] complaint [concerning] the members of the [Federal Electio
n Commission], who were 
then eight in number 
and two of whom were appointed 
by the President of the United States, two by the speaker of the House, and two by the president pro tem of the 
Senate, in each case with the advice and consent 
of both houses [of Congress].  The question rais
ed was whether or not the appointees of the House and Senate constituted so-called [unintelligible] officers of the United States within the 
meaning of article II, section 2 [of the U.S. Cons
titution], the same article that is brought into 
question by [the Reuss] lawsuit.   The Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Co
urt ruled that [the appointment process] 
portion of the [Federal Election Commission] act
 was unconstitutional [because] the functions and the duties of the election commission members 
were so substantive and of such far-reaching 
authority that [those performing them] had to be 
designated as officers of the United States.  And the failure of the statute to provide for appointment by the Presid
ent with the advice and consent [of the Senate] was a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.  It was 

thus overturned.  It is that case that they cite in parallel here, saying that the functions performed 
by this Committee are of such substantive natu
re that members performing those functions 
should be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  That™s the 
parallel for the case, President MacLaury.   
SPEAKER(?).  Recognizing the wisdom of our
 not commenting at this stage of the 
situation--obviously this is another act in the long-term effort of this man and his associates to 
challenge the way [the Federal Reserve System] f
unctions.  It is conceivable, I would assume, 
that as this evolves, this maneuver by Mr. Reuss 
could be made, in the minds of his colleagues in 
the Congress and the nation generally, to work against him.  This is another frantic--so, 
somewhere along the line it™s possible that we wo
uld be encouraged, I assume, to react in the 
public area to terms of this case.
  I mean, I think the man looks 
ridiculous in what he is doing. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I thi
nk that the story in the Wall Street Journal this morning takes 
care of the matter for the time being, beautifully. 
 Mr. Reuss tried to get this kind of provision through the Congress.  He has [not been able] 
to do so even in the House Banking Committee.  
And now, being frustrated, he turns to the courts.  And I would suppose Mr. Reuss would look rather ridiculous before his colleagues in the Congress.  He has not been able to persuade his colleagues.  He has emphasized the importance of 
larger congressional controls.  So suddenly, he turns to the courts to resolve the problems that 
he could have resolved if he had had the support and backing of the total Congress.  I think that, for the time 
being certainly, we ought not to comment on the case, and I would believe that others will do the commenting for us very 
effectively.   
6/22/76 - 5 - 
     SPEAKER(?).  My I say, sir, that the briefer story in the 
New York Times
 takes much the 
same line. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s hard for me to
 see how he can gain stature among his 
colleagues in the Congress by this [unintelligible].  
SPEAKER(?).  If pressed by reports, I would [unintelligible] is a point to be made that we 
cannot comment at this time in view of the le
gal proceeding, [which] we would complicate?  
MR. O™CONNELL.  That™s perfectly valid.  The matter 
is now in court, and I think, with good reason, at this time the pendency in 
court makes it wise to make no comment. 
SPEAKER(?).  I agree with you. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think that any comment
 runs the risk of igniting passions.  And 
the calm attitude on our part, I thi
nk is only good sense.  There is a lawsuit, it™s before the courts, it isn™t even proper to comment.  Any other questions?  Mr. Mayo. 
MR. MAYO.  Question for counsel.  Tom, is th
ere any legal risk that the decisions made by this Committee today will be overturned in the process of this suit? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  In my judgment, there is none, President Mayo. The complaint does 
not ask for  a temporary restraining order.  Th
e case has been assigned as
 of this morning to 
Judge Parker.  There is nothing in the request that asks it be taken this morning before that court 
or that he certify as a matter of emergency the 
appeal to the Court of 
Appeals for a three-judge court.  I would think that today™s actions by the Committee are clear of
 any impact from this suit.   
MR. MAYO.  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Balles. 

MR. BALLES.  Tom, you cast some doubt on wh
ether Mr. Reuss really has standing to bring this suit.  Is there any need
 to [unintelligible] to perfect his 
position to get standing, or if he 
doesn™t have standing, who else might?  That™s the first question.   
Second question, this may be premature, but if
 you care to express an informal tentative 
view, how do you think this thing might turn out-
-if you fail on the possible order for dismissal 
based on lack of standing--just on the merits of 
the case.  Is there any reasonable clear possible 
outcome one way or another? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I™ll answer that very briefly.  I can™t answer it, President Balles.  On 
the second question, the merits, the constitutiona
lity, a lot would depend upon the composition of 
the court, the three-judge court.  If the chief judge at the Court of Appeals, Judge Bazelon, assigns this to himself, togeth
er with Judge Parker and perhaps Judge Bryant, whom we™ve had 
in the earlier case, I™d say a decision in our favor is at question.  There are judges in the Federal District Court here whom I would view with pleasure [if we were] to appear before [them] to argue this question on its merits--the constituti
onality of this statute--because [those judges] 
would quickly pierce the allegation of unconstitutiona
lity as it relates to this Committee, but I 
6/22/76 - 6 - 
    think favorably to the Committee.  So a great deal will depend on the composition of the three-
judge court on the constitutional issue.   On the earlier issue of standing, as to whether or not he can better perfect [his standing], we had a case in 1963 in which I represented th
is Committee.  It was the Bryant case, in 
President MacLaury™s District, in Montana, and th
e same basic issue of the constitutionality of 
the appointment process, although not ex
actly parallel, was then raised.   In that case, the plaintiff owned a Federal Reserve note, and he challenged the actions of this Committee that impacted the value of that 
note.  We filed a motion to dismiss there.  He 
asked for a three-judge court.  The Federal 
District Judge, seeing that the Committee had 
substantially disproved the likelihood of his recovery or the substantiality of his allegations, granted our motion to dismiss and deni
ed his right of recourse to a three-judge court.  It is on that thesis that I would like to believe that Mr. Re
uss™s assertion of his status as a member of 
Congress on one hand, or his ownership of government securities on the other, [doesn™t] 
sufficiently distinguish him from a total class of 
individuals as to warrant his standing to bring suit.  Hopefully he couldn™t improve [his standing], either.    
MR. MACLAURY.
  Thank you, Tom. MR. JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, what provi
sions do we have in the by-laws or incorporation certificates of the Federal Reserve 
Banks to authorize the Banks to defend actions of its elected officers in their official capacity
?  To commit the resources of the Banks to the 
defense of the officers totally or the indemnification of the officers? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  If I may, Mr. Chairman, I thi
nk the basic right of the Banks to act in behalf of the corporation is contained in the Federal Reserve Act, among enumerated powers of 
the Federal Reserve Banks.   MR. JACKSON.  What about the officers and their [unintelligible] capacity as such? MR. O™CONNELL.  Right.  To my knowledge, th
ere is no provision in law for indemnification.  And some months ago, we inst
ituted a form of indemnification that would 
assure indemnification for acti
ons properly taken.  As to the right of the Banks to defend individually the actions of their officers, I™d suggest that, in these cases, where it™s alleged in a federal district court suit that their actions are those of officers 
of the United States, [those cases are] properly postured for defense either by th
is Committee as a body or 
by representation by the Department of Justice.  Does
 that satisfy your question? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question?  Yes, Mr. Mayo.   
MR. MAYO.  This may not be too relevant, To
m, but it raises a question in my mind that, 
if this is unconstitutional, wouldn™t the fixing of 
the discount rate by our boards of directors be 
unconstitutional since that™s one of our major tools of monetary policy? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Well, by analogy, President Mayo, the substantive quality of that action, as it might be alleged in 
parallel with this suit certainly could be brought into question.  I think any number of such actions might parallel and be brought in
to issue by a plaintiff.  Which 6/22/76 - 7 - 
    is why I think that it™s critical that [we take] a very
 clear, careful approach 
to our response to this 
complaint. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question?  Yes, Mr. Guffey. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Tom, with respect to Chairman
 Reuss™s attorneys, did his Committee staff 
file this case 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes.  I should comment, President Guffey, Mr. Crews was formerly 
in the legal division of the Board.  He™s a very careful and astute lawyer.  At the present time, to 
the best of my knowledge, he is on the staff of Mr. Reuss.  He visited me yesterday to advise me 
of the filing of the suit. 
MR. GUFFEY.  It raises a second question, Tom--you and I have had discussions in the 
past about the quality of legal work that may be tendered to us by the Justice Department. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Yes. MR. GUFFEY.  And I guess I share some of 
Paul Volcker™s concern that sometime down 
the road we might want to empl
oy counsel to assist you rather than rely totally upon the Justice Department.  You find that that quality of defens
e is not as great as we™d like, and what I™m 
suggesting is that it may be within the power of
 the Committee to [hire outside counsel].  I don™t 
think we ought to lose sight of that fact.   MR. O™CONNELL.  As I say, my conversation last night
 was with the assistant attorney general and then with the chief for the general li
tigation section [at the Justice Department], the 
latter gentlemen being, I think, a very high-quality
 lawyer.  But the trouble is, of course, that Denis Lender himself won™t actually pen the br
ief work.  I don™t know yet to whom it will be 
assigned.  I™d like to believe that we can closet immediately with the Justice Department and begin the course of thinking with respect to
 the makeup, composition, a
nd functions of this 
Committee so as to enable them to wr
ite the very, very [best] brief.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I interpret Mr. Guffey™s question to me as follows:  Suppose that 
you reach the conclusion that outside counsel 
could be helpful and that some outstanding 
constitutional lawyer might join you in the defens
e.  I take it that was the question, and I would assume that you would have the 
authority.  Could you do that?   
MR. O™CONNELL.  I™d be both pleased and privileged to have such assistance.  I would 
say, Mr. Chairman-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We will have such assist
ance if you deem it advisable.  That is, do 
you have the authority to do that or would you ne
ed authority from this Committee to empower 
you to employ a consultant if you reach the conc
lusion that outside legal counsel could be helpful?  
MR. O™CONNELL.  I would ask the Committee™s auth
ority to employ such counsel.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, let™s give Mr. O™Connell that authority now. 
6/22/76 - 8 - 
    SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 
SPEAKER(?).  Seconded. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any objection?  All right.  That is the authority, it™s not to hire legal counsel-- MR. O™CONNELL.  I understand. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --the authority is to hire legal counsel if you, in your judgment, 
arrive at the conclusion that that would be he
lpful in defending the Committee, the individual 
members of [unintelligible]
 against this lawsuit. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I understand, Mr. Chairman. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Tom, is there any possibility
 that the Justice Department runs into a 
conflict of interest in defending the Federal Open Market Committee against a congressman? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  I think the Department has 
first to answer the question, and I haven™t yet explored it with them.  Can the Department
 under title 5 represent individually named Bank 
Presidents where, at least at the outset, you don™t have them constituting an agency of the United 

States?   
Now, once I get over that hurdle, the second question you™d impose, perhaps, may be 
raised.  I don™t know of another instance in wh
ich the [Justice] Department has been positioned 
in representation of an agency against a member
 of Congress, or against the Committee itself, 
and so forth.  I do know that, on occasion when
 a committee of the Congress officially made 
demands on this agency with respect to examin
ation reports, and where the question of leakage of information from this Board became an issue,
 a representative of the criminal division of the 
Justice Department appeared before a committ
ee of Congress and in effect represented the position of the Chairman and the Bo
ard in calling in the FBI.   
So there have been instances in which th
ey™ve apparently take
n the position that was [unintelligible] to the thrust of the Committee.  That™s not quite
 where you™re headed, but it may 
give us a sense of their willingness to do so. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, Mr. Gardner? MR. GARDNER.  Tom, the Reserve Bank Presid
ents, the members of the Committee, are 
defendants, along with the Banks.  What does Reuss ask, considering the worst case?  He asks 
simply, in my view--and I would 
like your comments--that the cour
t enjoin the defendant from 
serving.  That the court will enjoin the Banks from
 carrying out the order, 
that the court declare 
part of the Federal Reserve Act unconstitutional.  That seems to me to be the most significant 

part of the [case], crippling our operations. 
 On a worst-case basis, the court will-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You say crip
pled--[but if that is] the deci
sion of the court, then the powers of the Federal Open Market Committee 
would be taken over by the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Reserve Board could act five minutes after the court decision is handed 
6/22/76 - 9 - 
    down.  So the [Federal Reserve] System, in its opera
tions, would not be crippled.  At least that is 
one interpretation. SPEAKER(?).  Well, Mr. Chairman, we get curious results if he enjoins the Banks from 
carrying out open market operations.  Conceivably th
at stops all of the action of this Committee.  
The Committee itself does not conduct the open 
market operations, it must be done by the 12 
Banks on the statute. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It would have to be done on the basis of some understanding 
between the Federal Reserve Board and the Banks, and immediately with the New York Bank in 
its operations of the Desk. SPEAKER(?).  Well, I guess what I™m suggesting-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All that I™m trying to sa
y is that if the worst happens, we are not going to have a national financial crisis, as I see it.   
MR. GARDNER.  Mr. Chairman, I didn™t mean 
to open Pandora™s box.  I was looking at the [plaintiff™s] prayer for relief, and what I™m getting at is ho
pefully a comment from counsel on the fact that this appears to me to be a totally 
technical ﬁprincipalﬂ suit, 
in which the individual Bank Presidents do not appear to have any liability.   While we are discussing retaining counsel in assisting Mr. O™Connell, I™m just trying to point out that on a worst-case basis, the plaintiff has simply asked for an injunction that would 
prevent the defendants from [unintelligible].  
And the cost granted to the plaintiff, and [unintelligible] what other and further relief may 
be proper--I don™t read into that any liability or 
what have you [for the Presidents].  Do you? MR. O™CONNELL.  I do not.  It™s always possible that the named defendants could be 
asked [unintelligible] to share in any liability for loss of valu
e in the so-called ownership of government securities by the plaintif
f.  But that is such a nebulous allegation that I think there is no possibility of personal liability of the named defendants.  I agree with that-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Not in this lawsuit.  
MR. O™CONNELL.  In this lawsuit. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  But let™s say the cour
t handed down the decision in favor of Mr. Reuss.  Then another lawsuit may be brought agai
nst Bank Presidents because of early actions in 
which they participated--am I romancing? 
MR. O™CONNELL.  If I may comment-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The court hands down the decision in favor of Mr. Reuss, and I bring a lawsuit on the grounds that my personal fortune has been hurt because interest rates went up.  And this increase in interest rates and loss in capital value of the securities that are held was brought about by the Bank Presidents acting unlawfully in this Committee.  Acting 

unconstitutionally.  I couldn™t do that?   
6/22/76 - 10 - 
    MR. O™CONNELL.  You could bring such a 
complaint.  I would question even the 
possibility of recovery, Mr. Chairman, for the reas
on that prior to this suit, actions taken by the Presidents as members of this Committee were pursuant to lawful authority.  And if the court 

should determine that, pursuant to Mr. Reu
ss™s complaint, the provision of law is 
unconstitutional, there can be no direct attribution in that finding to the members™ actions.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I understand.  Let me ask this question.  Is Mr. Reuss acting as 
chairman of the House Banking Comm
ittee or as a private citizen?  
MR. O™CONNELL.  A little bit of both, Mr. Chairman.  He alleges as a ground for 
standing that he is a member of 
Congress and is thus bringing this suit.  He enumerates the fact 
that he™s also chairman of the committee.  The 
letter transmitting advice of this suit, addressed to 
you, to which we responded, was signed by him as ch
airman of the committee.
  It™s a little bit difficult to sort out the position in 
which he purports to hold himself-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Personally, I would think he™d be in some difficulty with his 
committee to the extent that he acts in this capaci
ty as chairman of the committee.  I assume that 
he hasn™t consulted with his full committee. 
SPEAKER(?).  Is it not conceivable that 
his committee could disavow this action and 
remove him as chairman?  In other word
s, when things start working within-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I would think so. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  Well, except that I think that not
hing in his complaint--if I may, he 
describes himself on page 2 of the complaint as
, ﬁplaintiff is a member of the United States 
House of Representatives, Chairman of 
the Committee on Banking, Currency, and Housing, 
which pursuant to rule 101D of the Rules of the House has jurisdiction over legislative matters 
relating to [unintelligible].ﬂ  And he describes, of course, the rules™ description of the function of 

that committee.  [The text continues,] ﬁThe pl
aintiff is also Chairman of the Subcommittee on 
International Economics and the Joint Economic 
Committee, establishedﬂ etc.  And ﬁThe 
plaintiff is the owner of certain marketable 
bonds whose aggregate costs,ﬂ etc. ﬁ$20,000.ﬂ   This is his description of himself as plainti
ff.  It mixes his position as a member of the 
Congress, as a private citizen with ownership of government securities, a
nd as chairman of two [congressional] committees.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I don™t know if members of [his
] committee would react, but 
a member of the committee might raise the questi
on about the propriety of Mr. Reuss™s acting in this manner without first consulting with the committee.  That is, bringing the lawsuit, 

addressing such a letter to me, and using legal staff of the committee for the purpose.  
MR. O™CONNELL.  Now, I should say that, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Crews, plaintiff™s counsel, is an employee of
 that staff.  I stand subject to correction.  I™ll try to ascertain that today.  He may be 
outside counsel.  The last I knew he was on the-- SPEAKER(?).  He is on the Hill.  He is not li
sted as a member of the committee™s staff.  
Although I think what he said earlier, Tom, is pr
obably that he is a member of Reuss™s personal 
6/22/76 - 11 - 
    staff. I think we also should say that removi
ng [unintelligible] as committee chairman--it appears 
that the final judgment on that rests with the 
Democratic caucus.  The House Banking Committee 
as such would not remove the committee chairm
an, only the Democratic 
caucus could take such 
a position. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, there is another dimension that I think you should bear in 
mind, Tom.  The President of the United States is
 indirectly involved in this case, because what is being questioned is the exercise of his appoi
ntment power.  And that may possibly have some 
bearing on how the Justice Department looks at th
e case, and that ties in with a question that Governor Coldwell raised before.  All I suggest is that you keep this dimension in mind.   
MR. O™CONNELL.  I shall, Mr. Chairman.  It c
ould be asserted that the complaint in its 
deepest meaning is asserting the authority of the 
[U.S.] President and supp
orting that authority. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And it™s an authority that [U.S.] Presidents traditionally and constitutionally will seek to defend.  That is the point of my comment.   
MR. O™CONNELL.  May I make one further 
comment, too, Mr. Chairman, a matter that 
we have touched upon before the Committee and as
 to which you counseled that it be treated 
with the utmost confidence.  That relates to 
the Government in the Sunshine legislation.   
If the language of the bill as now proposed with respect to the definition of agency were to 
be enacted into law, we have [stated] the possi
bility that this Committee could take the position 
that the law is not applicable to the Committ
ee because the members of the Committee are not 
appointed to such a position by the President.  Now, 
if that™s the issue, I 
will want very carefully and gingerly to approach our defense in this case with respect to whether or not the members of 
this Committee are officers of the United States a
nd should be appointed by the President, etc.  I am merely advising in advance that I want to
 walk a very careful line, Mr. Chairman.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good.  Any other questions?  I think we have probably gone as far as we can on informing our
selves about this lawsuit.   MR. O™CONNELL.  Mr. Chairman, I apologize, I should 
advise that I™ve arranged at five o™clock this evening for a conference call to the counsel of each of the Reserve Banks merely to 
apprise them of the content of this complaint and its general makeup. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good. 
MR. WALLICH.  If [we lose] 
the suit, would that affect any past actions taken by the Committee? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think Tom has 
already answered that question. 
MR. O™CONNELL.  In my judgment, Governor
, I would argue that on the basis of the complaint itself, there™s no necessary application to previous actions of the Committee, and it 

could be all futuristic in te
rms of its applicability, dependi
ng on what the Court of Appeals finally rules.  I think it would not have any im
pact on past actions.  Although as the Chairman 
6/22/76 - 12 - 
    has mentioned, we can™t preclude citizen John, on
 the basis of the decision of the Court of Appeals, from filing suit, [unintelligible] past injury. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Gentlemen, I need hardly
 say that life at the Federal Reserve is 
very interesting.  We™ll turn 
to our regular business.   [End of executive session] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We would like to have the report of the Foreign Exchange [Trading] Desk. MS. GREENE.  Thank you.  It is a pleasure for me to be here. 
 Since your last meeting, the 
dollar continued [unintelligible] it tried to reach in early June at the highest levels against the major European currencies since late January.  
This latest advance ha
d been triggered by the upward advancement in short-term U.S. interest ra
tes; in addition, evidence of a further reduction in unemployment, generally favorable [unintelligib
le] performance, and a lower trade deficit for 
April underpin a generally positive [market] 
sentiment.  Subseque
ntly, the dollar eased fractionally from early June levels once the rise in 
short-term interest rates leveled off, but then it 
remained stable against many important currenc
ies, especially the German mark, even as 
tensions deepened in the ma
rket for other currencies.  
 Meanwhile, the markets focused their attenti
ons on sterling and the Swiss franc.  Sterling continued its deep plunge as the market, now tota
lly demoralized, took little
 notice of the recent and substantial increase in Britain™s export 
sales or of a growing acceptance among trade union 
memberships of the need for an accepted constrai
nt on wages.  Instead, concerns deepened as 
[unintelligible] fall in sterling threatened to reignite union opposition to the government™s pay 
policy.   At the same time, parliamentary debate 
over public spending [unintelligible] on the government™s entire economic program.  The Ba
nk of England, which had earlier provided heavy support for the pound, eased up its dollar sales as reserves came close to being depleted.  
And with dealers also no longer willing to take sterling into their positions, the rate dropped without resistance to just about $1.70, some 15.8 percent below levels
 of just last March.  This drop was far greater than any corrections needed simply to offset Britain™s relatively high 
inflation rate; moreover, it had very serious cons
equences, not only for the British government™s 
efforts to contain inflation at home but also 
on competitive relationships
 throughout Europe.   
The announcement of a $5.3 billion dollar cr
edit for England by the Group of Ten countries, Switzerland, and the BI
S [Bank for International Sett
lements] consequently had a 
strongly positive and immediate impact and was 
followed  up with simultaneous operations in 
sterling by the Bank of England in both London and through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  It [unintelligible] a covering of s
hort sterling positions and a sharp rebound in the 
[unintelligible] race.  Since then the govern
ment pay policy has been accepted by the Trade 
Union Congress by an overwhelming majority.  In
 addition, the Bank of England took advantage of the shortage of liquidity in the domestic money market to engineer an even greater squeeze on 
speculative positions [unintelligible] in the Eurosterling market.   
6/22/76 - 13 - 
    Nevertheless, the market for sterling remains fr
agile.  Many participants
 were disappointed that the government has not adopted
 further anti-inflationary meas
ures, and consequently sterling does not yet have sufficient buoyancy to offset a continuing flow of commercial offers in the 
market.  The Bank of England, therefore, has 
continued to provide supports for the crown, selling--since the June 7 announcement at 
around the $1.77 level--almost $550 million.  The bulk 
of this will be covered by a requested [unint
elligible] by the Bank of England on the Group of 
Ten standby of 10 percent of the total arrangement, hopefully valued tomorrow.   
By contrast, the Swiss franc remained strong 
against both the dollar and the German mark 
during the period.  To counter this trend, the Swiss authorities introduced harsh measures and cut 
the discount rate to limit new inflows into Swi
ss francs.  In addition, the [Swiss] National Bank 
pledged to intervene massively if
 necessary; it also agreed that a German government borrowing 
denominated in German marks be placed with 
a consortium of Swiss banks.  This renewed 
demonstration of determination to
 resist the Swiss franc™s persis
tent rise, together with Swiss bidding for marks before the paydown of the Ge
rman government loan, helped for a while to 
relieve the upward pressure on the franc.  But to the extent that the German mark was 

simultaneously nudged higher in the European 
community [unintelligible], it brought those 
currencies close to the band [unintelligible] such as the Dutch guilder, again under pressure.   Thus, the situation on the Continent also rema
ined fluid.  During the period, the Federal Reserve was asked by several other central banks to intervene on their behalf in the New York 
market.  As exchange trading has become mo
re and more a 24-hour business, many central 
banks have found it useful to follow up operations in
 their respective market
s with operations in our market after their close.  On that basis 
we have sold since May 18 more than $170 million 
with the Swiss banks; with the Swiss National Bank we have pur
chased $77 million of sterling 
from the Bank of England; and we have bought
 over $35 million worth of guilders with the 
Netherlands Bank.   We did not intervene with the System account.  Instead, we continued to acquire Belgian francs, buying about $26 million worth, and repaid
 $20 million on our outstanding swap debt in 
that currency.  In addition, the System was able to add to its balances of German marks, which 
now amount to $53 million equivalent, and only bega
n to buy small amounts of Dutch guilders, a 
currency which we have also used to intervene from time to time.   
Our total balances apart from those held against outstanding swap debts now amount to 
$58 million, well below the $150 million figure that 
the Committee agreed last September would 
be appropriate.  I have two points to raise with regard to recommendations.    
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Ar
e there any questions? 
MR. EASTBURN.  Do you have any idea where the British expect the pound to be? MS. GREENE. I don™t have any information on that. 
 I do feel--and it is just a feeling--that they do wish to have the beneficial effects of the package demonstrated in the market, and so 
they have wished to keep the rate higher than where it was at the time of the announcement.   
MR. PARTEE.  The first drawing, you are saying they will beat the mark? 
6/22/76 - 14 - 
    MS. GREENE.  That™s right. MR. PARTEE.  And then there will be-- MR. STERNLIGHT.  About $200 million of 
it would have a reserve impact.  
MR. PARTEE.  That is our 200 of the total 550. MR. STERNLIGHT.  And as it happens, it would fit rather well with other things that are 
happening to reserves.  It presents no problem from that standpoint. 
MR. WALLICH.  From your observation of th
e market, when sterling was going down as 
you said--without resistance, I think--would you have said that was a disorderly market? 
SPEAKER(?).  I think by all of the attributes 
of disorderliness we have spoken of in the past, the sterling market would certainly 
qualify as being disorderly, yes.   SPEAKER(?).  Would you call it a disord
erly market, Governor Wallich?   
MR. WALLICH.  If I had to stre
tch a point in order to be able to intervene, I would, yes. MR. COLDWELL.  I presume this drawing you 
are talking about will be pro rata among 
all the members of the group? 
SPEAKER(?).  As the request went out in the 
cable we received on Friday, it would be pro rata against all central banks a
nd governmental agencies.  That 
includes all participants except 
the BIS.  There currently are negotiations under way as to whether or not that pro rata situation should [include] or can exclude the BIS.  The Treasury was under the assumption that the BIS 
would be included in a manner similar to ot
her participants; however, the BIS was under a different impression, apparently, and the Bank of
 England will be going to the BIS to finance 
outstanding short-dated swaps, which would be outstanding over the month-end.   
So the total participation of the BIS, if [unint
elligible] to conclude the financing of short-term swaps, would be far greater than the $15 milli
on that would [unintelligible] to a 10 percent 
draw.  There are a variety of issues outstanding, and it is for those reasons that we have not been able to confirm the drawing or actually [unint
elligible] on the takedown of this particular drawing.   MR. MACLAURY.  I was just going to ask, to the extent that OPEC countries™ sterling 
balances seem to have been a major part of th
e pressures on sterling before the package, whether they continue to be described as continuing commercial selling in the market following the 
package. 
MS. GREENE.  Well, undoubtedly there has been
 some OPEC selling of sterling, because 
there are some large sterling holders on the part
 of a few remaining OPEC members.  But the 
most surprising source of pressure there has been the many countries, not OPEC, that have 
historically held large amounts of sterling and have been disinvesting their sterling holdings over a period of several months.  Probably they are 
equally important in te
rms of the amount of 
6/22/76 - 15 - 
    sterling sold.  Furthermore, 
probably quantitatively the most
 important has been adverse movements in commercial [unintelligible].  A
nd the kind of continuing business we see in the sterling market on the sale side does 
appear to be largely commercial. 
MR. MACLAURY.  In the case of diversification of previous sterling holders, do we have any [unintelligible] as to whether they are diversifying into dollars or into a broader range of currencies or into marks, or yen, or is it unknown? 
MS. GREENE.  Well, those countries with acco
unts with us look like they are diversifying largely into dollars, but that would make sense from the point of view of the composition of their 
trade.  There may be other countries who are al
so diversifying with accounts elsewhere whose 
activities we cannot so easily track. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions?  Thank 
you, Miss Green.  And now a motion to approve would be in order.  I take it that the transactions for the Desk are approved.  I should have asked you this question, Miss Green.  Is the Bundesbank participating in trading in sterling?  
Did it intervene? 
MS. GREENE.  As it turned out, the Bundesbank did not need to, although there had been some [unintelligible] into the 
weekend that the Bundesbank would join in the intervention on the day of the announcement. 
 As it turned out-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Did it not intervene at any time? 
MS. GREENE.  In sterling? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  In sterling, since the 5.3 billion standby [unintelligible]-- MS. GREENE.  As I said, they did not need to.  The day of the announcement was a 
holiday on the Continent, and the Bundesbank was closed, and the German market was closed 
that day, and by the second day there was no need for such a [unintelligible].  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Thank you.  May we
 have your recommendations, Ms. Greene? MS. GREENE.  Certainly.  Two drawings on Federal Reserve swap drawings come due 
before the next meeting.  The first is the 
$360 million Mexican drawing.  So far this year, 
Mexico has made progress in bringing down in
flation, while its current account position has improved in response to the economic recovery he
re.  But inasmuch as the swap matures just 
after the July 4 presidential election date, we understood at the time 
of the drawing and also from 
more recent conversations that the 
Bank of Mexico might well wish to renew.  In that event, we 
would recommend renewal for another two months. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very well.  Any objection on the part of the Committee? 
MR. COLDWELL.  This is a first renewal? 

MS. GREENE.  This would be a first renewal. 6/22/76 - 16 - 
     SPEAKER(?).  You do not know for certain wh
ether they will renew, but you think they 
will. 
MS. GREENE.  As of a conversatio
n yesterday, they think it very likely that they will wish to. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any further questions? MR. JACKSON.  Do we have any informa
tion about activities along the Southwestern border indicating a change in people™s attitude toward the peso?  That might be a more general 
question than the Desk would be informed about. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Mr. Volcker, it may 
be irrelevant here.  We continue 
to hear a very substantial amount of discussion re
lative to a  probable devaluation of the Mexican currency.  And we hear conversation on the part of U.S. businessmen conducting a substantial 
amount of business in Mexico in the context of 
a 10- to 12-month time frame.  The San Antonio 
and El Paso Branches have not seen a reflow of the large volum
e of large denomination currency 
withdrawn prior to Good Friday, as normally woul
d have been expected to take place by this time.  We do see indications of continued dema
nd for large denominations of U.S. currency.  
They are not pressing us for it when we say we are out at the moment; 
they say ﬁwe™ll check elsewhere,ﬂ which suggests that they may be finding such currency in commercial banks. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right, is the Committee of a 
mind to approve a renewal of the 
Mexican drawing? SPEAKER(?).  Moved and seconded. 

MS. GREENE.  The next is the Italian situation.  As Mr. Holmes anticipated at the last 
meeting, the Bank of Italy did request a renewal 
of its second $250 million swap when it matures 
on June 27.  And the Bank of Italy agreed to the same conditions we had imposed upon renewal 

of the first drawing.  Now that first draw
ing, also $250 million, will be coming due for the 
second time on July 22.  According to my conversa
tion with the Bank of Italy last week, they do intend to repay, but so far the Bank of Italy has drawn on only $500 million of the total $750 
million that we made available to them in February, and so they still have $250 million to be 
drawn as they need.  I don™t have a specific recommendation to make 
in this regard, but I think it very possible that there may be a 
third request in the near future. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are there any questions?  SPEAKER(?).  Is this a renewal? 

MS. GREENE.  When the draw issue comes up in
 July, when it matures, that would be at 
the end of its first renewal period.  As a condition of the drawing, they agreed to repay after a first renewal period. And they intend to do so.  
However, they have $250 million left, and they 
are obviously in an uncertain situation at the moment with the el
ections just completed, and so it 
is very conceivable that within the next month 
there might be a request for a third drawing.  [If 
so,] that would, by the time of the next meeti
ng, [leave] the total amount of their indebtedness 
into the [unintelligible] unchanged.   6/22/76 - 17 - 
    SPEAKER(?).  You mean they might borrow from us in order to repay us? 
SPEAKER(?).  That™s what it sounds like to me. 

MS. GREENE.  In effect. 

MR. PARTEE.  In any event, this particular drawing would-- 
MS. GREENE.  I am not asking for a renewal.  
I am simply anticipati
ng [unintelligible] of letting in a third drawing, which might be at a ti
me other than the repayment date.  But in the 
future. 
MR. WALLICH.  If that occurred, then [the
ir debt] would never mature.  Because they 
would extinguish one debt by creating a new debt. SPEAKER(?).  We would have to be a party to that. 

SPEAKER(?).  I agree. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  And we are not likely to.  No action is required on the Italian [unintelligible].  Any further questions?  We
 owe you thanks, Miss Green.  We will now have 
Mr. Gramley™s report on the economy. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  [Secretary's not
e: This statement was not found in Committee records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We™re ready for the economics discussion, and let me just say one 
word before we turn to that.  At the last
 meeting, the Committee decided to expand on the 
discussion in the Redbook, and particularly to gather information from our [Reserve Bank] 
directors concerning the rate of utilization of industrial capacity.  Mr. Mayo took the responsibility of monitoring that effort, and 
this month™s Redbook is a great improvement over 
the past.  I have been very pleased with it, and I hope the rest of the Committee has found it of 
substantial benefit as well.   Well, we™re ready for our discussion, and I think what we would want to do in the course of this discussion is to not concentrate on detail and technical matters but either reinforce or 
question the judgments that Mr. Gr
amley has expressed.  Any comment? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman--a speculative questi
on, but I encountered in a number of places a possible explanation of the weakness 
of retail sales, particularly in soft goods recently.  It is that, this year, people think there will be gas available for whatever kind of 

vacation travel they might wish to engage in, 
and therefore that is 
affecting their current spending.  I was interested that this was not mentioned anywhere 
in the Redbook or Greenbook, and I was wondering whether you had any reaction to it? CHAIRMAN BURNS.  You mean that people 
are saving up a little money to spend on 
automobile travel in conjunction with
 vacation, etc.?  That is the thought? 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  That™s what I™ve been running into. 6/22/76 - 18 - 
    CHAIRMAN.  Very interesting.  I have not run into that.  Mr. Gramley? 
MR. GRAMLEY.  I have not heard any such
 comment.  I mentioned one thing in connection with this weakness in retail sales, which is that if you believe the weekly figures, we 
do now seem to be coming out of that.  The weekly figures have been untrustworthy in the past, and I don™t want to make too much of it, but si
nce about the middle of 
May, the weekly figures 
have suggested a general upward course, and the auto sales figures have also improved.  There 
could be all sorts of reasons for that, including what President Baughman and I think, which is 
that there just isn™t any evidence at this point th
at this is anything other than a very temporary pause. MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, I might fo
llow up on Ernie™s point with the comment that Bicentennial tourism has not proved to be as large as expected.  Our hotels are running only 80 to 85 percent of capacity, which is lower than they expected.  I understand that this is not confined to Philadelphia but it also applies to Washington.  
MR. PARTEE.  It™s true of Washington.  
There have been reports in the press. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, should this be the peak season?  Or is not the peak season ahead of us?  If 80 to 85 percent now, it might we
ll be 95 percent for the first weeks in July.   
MR. EASTBURN.  Could be, and I think people are waiting to see [whether] their 
expectations have been fulfilled. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  Press reports in Washington ha
ve it that the level of its tourism in 
Washington is actually below last year™s. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Below last? 

MR. GRAMLEY.  Hotel occupancy is below last year™s. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Below last 
year™s.  That™s very, very-- SPEAKER(?).  Mr. Chairman, we had a c
onversation over the weekend with the May company people, headquartered in St. Louis, a
nd they™re normally quite 
sensitive to trends.  They™re still totally on dead center in terms of 
not having a real feel for which way consumer 
spending is going on the retail level.  They™re cautious.  They™re not pessimistic, but they™re far 
from exuberant in terms of their an
alysis of the rest of the year. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Partee. 

MR. PARTEE.  Well, let me say that, looking 
at this last chart that Mr. Gramley has 
distributed, I think it certainly fortifies my view that this is a te
mporary kind of a move in retail 
sales.  I was fully expecting them to come bac
k, too.  Indeed, I would point out that the last couple of months of observations in this retail sales line are based on preliminary data.  And if 
there was something of the kind that Ernie was 
mentioning going on, that is, a tendency not to spend in conventional ways at the department st
ores and so forth, but rather to spend in the course of vacations, that™s a very hard thing for retail data to pick up--the restaurant sales in 
6/22/76 - 19 - 
    small towns and the motel rentals and that kind of 
thing.  And so it could well be that what we™re looking at here is going to largely disappear in the course of revisions.  But I think that 
[unintelligible] personal income 
and unemployment certainly suggest
 that retail sales ought to be strengthening in the course of the summer as we go along. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you.  Mr. Black, please. 
MR. BLACK.  Lyle, I think I come out about where the staff did on business spending on 
plant and equipment, but I can™t find too many bu
sinessmen who feel that ebullient about it.  
They seem to be worrying about EPA and OSHA,
 and you might think that would add to their 
spending, but they seem to be 
having a reverse reaction.  Of course, they™re worried about the effects of inflation and the absence of a firm 
national energy policy and all sorts of things like this. In the oil industry, for example, one of our di
rectors is a high official and says that the move 
to break up the oil companies is practically para
lyzing the capital outlays by oil companies.  And 
since fears of this type tend to be exaggerated in an election year, I™m wondering if we are giving 
enough weight to some of these feelings.  
MR. GRAMLEY.  I think that™s a pretty good 
question, President Black.  My own feeling is that we could be on the high side in our estimated increase in plant and equipment 
expenditures.  Our estimated increase for the calendar year 1976 exceeds by a considerable 

margin what is projected in the Commerce anticipation survey.  We have felt justified in [that 

estimate] for several reasons.   
One, our model suggests that the sort of acceler
ator effect we should be getting from past 
increases in real consumer spending ought to be carrying through to the investment level in a 
rather vigorous way.  Two, business profits have been very good and are still moving up, and it 
should induce some changes in planning.  Third, 
new order figures have been unusually strong in the past five months--a 16 percent incr
ease since the first of this year.   
There are some signs of hesitancy.  The expect
ations figures do not look all that strong in the first quarter.  The Commerce survey does not show a particularly [large] improvement in 
spending plans from February to May.  The cons
truction contractors™ work figures are weak.  And we are concerned also about this problem of potential dive
stiture in the oil industry.   For the time being, I would want to stick with
 this kind of forecast on the general grounds 
that past cyclical experience rather strongly indicates that once you get a process of strongly advancing consumer spending under way, it does feed b
ack to the investment level.  But the next 
few months of information on plant and equipment 
spending could cause us to change our minds. 
MR. BLACK.  Well, I come out exactly there,
 too.  The Redbook sort of reinforced what I 
was hearing in our own area on that, and I just want to know how much 
we ought to weight it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questi
on or comment?  Mr. Wallich, please. 
MR. WALLICH.  I think you said, Lyle, that no re
duction in the rate of inflation was likely during the present expansion, which makes me feel
 [that the projection is] rather ominous.  Will 
it take another period of slowdown in order to get any improvement in inflation?  How are our 
6/22/76 - 20 - 
    wages likely to develop with productivity that would permit some
 reduction in inflation, perhaps during the expansion? MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, what I said was, I don™
t think we can realistically expect any slowdown in the underlying rate of inflation--[although] I don™t think it™s impossible.  What we 
have been projecting is an increase in compen
sation per man-hour in the range of 8-1/2 percent 
at annual rates.  And an improvement in productivity
 of close to 3 percent, which would give us about a 5-1/2 percent increase in unit labor costs.   I think favorable surprises could come from 
several sources.  For one thing, we have, generally speaking, been overestimati
ng the rate of increase in wage rates this year.  The rate of 
increase in wages has slowed more than we antic
ipated, and I think that the relatively favorable 
price developments have been importantly res
ponsible.  But the light collective bargaining schedule thus far has also been a factor, and ma
ybe we are going to get better performance than we had thought.   But I think we would want to be conservative.  I don™t think we can offer much hope for a 
better wage rate performance than 8-1/2 percent in terms of compensation.  We may get better 
increases in productivity, but here again, our estimates seem to us re
alistic.  A 3 percent rise is a half  percent above the long-term increase in productivity.  A thir
d source, of course, could be bumper crops, and again we can™t forecast th
at.  It could happen, but I don™t think one can 
realistically hold out much hope for them. 
MR. WALLICH.  Imports is a po
ssible source of lower prices? MR. GRAMLEY.  Gee, I would have a hard 
time imagining that a
ll foreign countries taken together are going to do better than we do in terms of rate of inflation.  Some perhaps 
will--Germany might.  I wouldn™t th
ink that the world from which 
we import generally will show 
lower increases in prices than we do.   MR. REYNOLDS.  But you may have in mind the rise of commodity prices that we 
already had.  But a lot of that, I think, may be 
a once-for-all adjustment.  For example, the rise in 
coffee prices and adjustment to a very [small] 
crop ought not to continue, it seems to me.  And 
even the rise in metals prices 
seems to owe something to cost in
creases and the fact that there™s 
been a very sharp turnaround from inventory liquidations to [unintelligible] liquidation.  But I don™t think we are headed for a runaway boom situation. 
 SPEAKER(?).  Given the determination of 
the recent EPC meeting, the country showed 
not to have a runaway boom.  That™s helpful. 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, let me go back to
 the question of retail sales.  Lyle, if you take as an assumption that we have had a ru
n-up in retail sales that was at least partly attributable to price increases,
 do we have anything in our data which would indicate that price increases [are easing], particularly for GAF [general merchandise, 
apparel, and furniture] stores, which I gather are showing further weakness in the last month or
 two.  Any evidence indicating a slowdown in the price changes with that type of commodity?   6/22/76 - 21 - 
    MR. GRAMLEY.  Well, I don™t think we have data
 relating specifically to GAF stores.  If you were to look at apparel prices, though, I don™t think you would see any significant evidence of a longer-term slowdown in prices.  The in
crease in apparel commodities during May was half of 1 percent.  And it [was] running about 2 or 3 tenths in previous months.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Lyle, what does the 
Federated Department Store price index 
show? MR. GRAMLEY.  I haven™t looked at that 
recently, Mr. Chairman, and I haven™t-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I haven™t either, and it would be interesting to check because that may provide an answer.   
SPEAKER(?).  At least a partial-- 

MR. GRAMLEY.  From what we have heard-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  A partial answ
er to Mr. Coldwell™s question. MR. GRAMLEY.  From qualitative reports about 
the situation in retail stores, we could see some price cutting.  We™ve understood that 
nondurable goods inventories are sufficiently 
high at the retail level as to ge
nerate some concern, and we have
 been told that there may be 
some price concessions to help move some of 
this merchandise.  They would presumably show 
up in the June CPI. MR. COLDWELL.  In other words, there™s an 
element here, too, Lyle, in the question of 
the kinds of commodities or goods wh
ich the public is buying.  If there has been a shift in that 
toward upgrading or something like that, which mi
ght be reflective of a kind of commodity that is not growing at a price rate [unintelligible], you might be having an effect here on your total 
retail sales. 
MR. GRAMLEY.  That™s a possibility, but from 
our discussions with people in the retail industry, there just isn™t any doubt that sales overall slumped in Apr
il and stayed at relatively low levels in May.  They were quite discouraged, and they were looking at increases in inventories that they found unacceptable. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Partee. 
MR. PARTEE.  I don™t recall that you said anything about housing, Lyle, but would you read the recent data as being rather disappointing? MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes, I would.  The increase 
in starts in May was only a little over 2 percent.  The permits figure was up around 5.  What
 we are seeing is a smaller rate of rise in 
the multifamily area than we had hoped for.  Th
e problems there are proving to be more deep-
seated and more intransigent than we had hoped for.  And we have trimmed down somewhat our 
increase in projected housing starts over the remainder of this year, mainly in the multifamily 
area.   
6/22/76 - 22 - 
    In the single-family area, I think we can look forward to some further gradual 
improvement.  But here the discourag
ing factor is that sales seem to
 have leveled out.  We just are not getting any further increases in sales in either new or existing homes through April, 
which is as far as the data go, and we did check
 qualitatively to see what May changes might 
have been.  And generally speaking, the market
 doesn™t seem to have shown any further 
improvement other than the normal seasonal rise. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, the homebuilder
s and realtors I™ve talked to on that subject--I was surprised at the optimism that 
was being expressed by this very unscientific sample of mine.  Do you have any observ
ations on that subject, Mr. Jackson? MR. JACKSON.  I think generally they™re optimistic.  But there™s 
no question about the figures Lyle talked about, that for the last three months the index of sales of existing homes is 
down and has not come back up.  The number of 
single-family units sold is down, and has not 
come back, which tends to suppor
t everything, except, perhaps, the permits figure, which is up.  
And although they are still generally op
timistic, there™s no question about this. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  The permits figure is 
up, and multifamily starts were up rather 
sharply last month. MR. JACKSON.  Up from a very low level--a less-low level I guess is
 about the best way you could say it.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Winn? 

MR. WINN.  Two things, Mr. Chai
rman.  One, there is perhaps more seasonality in retail 
inventories than we recognize, and to the extent that they get caught with spring merchandise, 
particularly in the nondurable things, they can™t always have price sales to get rid of it in summertime.  So it takes a little time to work so
me of these things off, and price cutting just doesn™t always do it.   Second is a remark on commodities.  I thi
nk the tremendous pickup in the volume of 
commodity transactions, particularly in copper, lead, and zinc, would lead you to believe that maybe there™s more than just consumption in that
 area, but perhaps we have a new international payments mechanism hedging against gold, which is
 no longer so attractive to many people, and 
also foreign exchange, with its greater fluctuatio
ns.  And more people are 
turning to copper, lead, and zinc as a way of protecting themselves in terms of international transactions, as well as 
inflation and other things.  I think the tremendous pickup in vo
lume in that area is rather 
significant. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very interesting point.  Any other comments on the economy?  
Well, we are in position to move ahead, and perhaps we will take a coffee break and resume our 

deliberations after.   
[Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We are ready to
 start Mr. Sternlight™s report. 6/22/76 - 23 - 
    MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Secretary's note: Th
is statement was not found in Committee 
records.] 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Sternlight.  It™s generally true that the operations at the [Domestic Trading] Desk are carried out with considerable skill, and I thought that during this past month it was especially true. 
MR. EASTBURN.  Peter, I was [unintelligible] 
pleased to see the analysis in the Bluebook 
about the nonborrowed reserves and how they work.  Do you have any feeling at this point as to how realistic the [nonborrowed reserves] simulation is now that you™ve seen this? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, we are attempting this simulation according to certain 
guidelines that we have set out.  The guidelines could be somewhat different.  I think it could be done along the lines that we are describing here, and the general result would be as we have described for each period, on balance.  It seems 
to me we would have tended to move [more 
firmly] on the [federal] funds rate
 than we actually did and would have had more variation in the 
funds rate.  I remain doubtful that this would r
eally serve the longer-term purposes of policy, but it™s still rather early to judge the exercise.  
MR. AXILROD.  If I may comment on that, 
Mr. Chairman.  As you know, we™re running 
at each interval, and the time before this [the 
simulation implied] somewhat higher [actual than 
targeted growth] rates for all reserve measures, a
nd in this case, [a] higher [actual growth rate] for nonborrowed [reserves] but much lower [ones]
 for  total [reserves and] the base.   The point I™d like to make in addition to thos
e Mr. Sternlight made is, if the Desk had 
achieved the [lower] rates two months ago, we ha
ve no way of putting into the simulation what 
actually could have been the case with regard 
to deposits in the current period; maybe rates 
would have been somewhat  [higher], for all I 
know, or unchanged.  It doesn™t necessarily mean 
that they™re [lower] and again [l
ower], because we™re not able to
 get the feedback effect in.  MR. EASTBURN.  May I comment also on that
, Mr. Chairman?  [Unintelligible,] the 
recommendations of the Subcommittee on the Directiv
e, we did, after all, have in there a federal funds constraint [unintelligible] so that it is a little difficult--in fact, it™s impossible, I guess--in a simulation, to really tell what would have happene
d, because if we had a fed funds constraint to 
live with [unintelligible] reserve operating targ
et, the outcome that we were talking about 
wouldn™t necessarily have to come about.  That is
, it is not completely clear to me if we would 
have greater funds rate variability [with] that nonborrowed reserves target than we do now.  Is that wrong, Peter? MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, again, I think it depends on what constraints we set ourselves.  We were working with kind of an internal rule that we would not want to see the average funds rate change by more than 25 basis points pe
r week.  We were permitting some backing and 
filling of the funds rate as we went through the 
period on these hypothetical scenarios.  If, early 
in the period, it looked as though we were going to come out substantially above path, and we 
assumed that we would be moving up in the f
unds rate, and the later evidence had us much weaker against the path we were assuming, then
 we would be more ge
nerous in the reserve provision and let the funds rate come down.   
6/22/76 - 24 - 
    No one can revise those internal rules so as to screen out those short-term residuals.  One 
could just construct a different exercise than the one we went through, so I think you are right, we wouldn™t necessarily have had to have greater variability, but I think we would then have been in a sense less faithful to the attempt to achieve the nonborrowed target.  
MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, one other obser
vation.  I would certainly echo your remark 
that the Desk carried out the operations with great skill in this period.  I was on the morning call 
for a good part of the period since the last meeti
ng.  One very definite impression I™m getting as 
a result of having paid close attention in this past month to the 
daily operations, and I would like to put this especially to Mr. Sternlight, is th
at the market sometimes 
overreacts to our direct purchases or sales in the market as opposed to pur
chases or sales to and from foreign accounts.  
They seem to read into it when we do direct mark
et transactions [unintelligible] move on our part 
to change the level of the funds rate.   I wonder if we would get away from this, to some
 extent at least, if we were targeting on, say, nonborrowed reserves rather than targeting on the funds rate itself.  I think the market is 
kind of overshooting in its reactions to your direct operations in the market as opposed to 
operations with foreign accounts, and the mark
et, I think, has to look on the defensive operations.   MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think you are certainly right that the ma
rket focuses more on overt 
operations that they see from us, and it™s natural 
because that™s what they are seeing directly.  
When the weekly statistics are published, they 
learn that we may have acquired bills from 
foreign accounts or sold to them.  I™m not sure that
 there™d be very much difference in that regard 
if we were working on a nonborrowed reserve target
.  It seems to me we™d still be conducting 
operations either with overt entries into the mark
et or operations that the market did not see as 
directly, and they would very possibly still exaggerate the significance of whatever they saw 
overtly from the Desk.  MR. JACKSON.  What problems would you have if, when you had mechanical failures 
like you had recently, you were operating on nonborro
wed reserves versus fed funds.  Fed funds 
information is something you get externally, wher
eas the nonborrowed is internally generated. MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, I think there coul
d be delays in getting the information 
together when there were mechanical failures. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Without implying any 
preference [unintelligible] operation over 
against another, if he had mechanical failures, 
you™d fall back on the federal funds rate because you had nothing else. MR. AXILROD.  In addition, Mr. Chairman, a m
echanical failure recently did also affect 
the fed funds rate because banks didn™t know their position or thought they had the wrong 

position, [which] actually caused the fed funds rate to be higher probably than otherwise it would have been.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other question or comment on the Sternlight report?   
6/22/76 - 25 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  I™d like to hear a little 
more--the comparative observability of our 
objectives under the two techniques--the fed funds rate, how early they can feel us out with nonborrowed reserves, how early can they figure out what the objectives are.  MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think that it is probably easier for the market to try to track us 
closely with the fed funds rate objective.  That™s something that they can read immediately from 
the market just as we can, whereas with a reserv
e objective, it would be a little more difficult for 
them to track us. 
MR. MACLAURY.  On that same point, I think 
the answer would obviously depend upon the extent to which we were prepared to follow the nonborrowed target regardless of day-to-day 
variations in the funds rate.  The answer you gave, it seems to me, implied that we would 
certainly be giving less weight to day-to-day stability of the funds rate and therefore [creating] greater difficulty in tracking exactly what we had in mind.   
I think that likewise has a bearing upon what so-called experts or professionals in the market can read from early disclosure of our decisions here.  Will we be following a 

nonborrowed reserves target and allowing the funds rate to move in a wider range than we now do, day to day?  It seems to me [that then] it wo
uld be much more difficult for the professionals 
to follow what we were doing or benefit or profit thereby even if we were to release our targets 
quickly.   SPEAKER(?).  I think that™s a good point-- 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think these [simulation]
 operations are useful.  If there™s going to be any change in the method of operating at the 
Desk, I think we need a little more experience, 
and I think the observations that have been made here are helpful to the Committee in thinking 

about our method or techniques of
 operating the Desk, but I don™t think we can decide, or should try to decide, on a change in operating the Desk at this time.  We need a little more time to 
observe what has been happening and to study the simulation exercises a little more for a longer 
period.  If the members of the Co
mmittee are ready to change or 
want to discuss a change now, of course, we can do that.  I doubt that we could-- MR. WALLICH.  Mr. Chairman, I would think th
at at most it™s a question of putting the 
nonborrowed reserves target where the RPDs [reserves available to 
support private nonbank deposits] used to be, in other words as a subsidiary element, not as a change in operating-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Are we ready for that?  If we are ready to include nonborrowed 
reserves as one of the factors to follow directly
 in the Desk™s operations, let™s indicate that by a 
show of hands.  Well, the majo
rity of the Committee clearly 
wants a little more time to-- 
MR. COLDWELL.  I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, it might be helpful, though, for either 
the next meeting or the one following, to have a r
ecap of the past four months that we have been 
tracking this and where the Desk thinks 
it might have to come out with these. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I haven™t kept precise track of the period, but let™s make it a 
six-month period. 
6/22/76 - 26 - 
    MR. WALLICH.  May I just verify a point
 in case I misunderstood it.  We can use 
nonborrowed reserves in two ways.  One is as one of the aggregate targets; that™s what I understand we discussed tonight.  Th
e other is a more ambitious step--to replace the funds rate 
by nonborrowed reserves and have the [System Op
en Account] Manager look at that and not look at the fed funds.  That I would not propose at this time. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Anything else to be said on that subject?  Any further comment on 
Mr. Sternlight™s report?  If not, a motion to approve operations at the Desk would be in order.  
Motion made and seconded. 
MR. AXILROD.  [Secretary's note: This statem
ent was not found in Committee records.]   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Axilrod.  Any questions to Mr. Axilrod? 
MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Axilrod, what is there 
in the situation now that [supports] the staff™s estimate of strengthening business demand? 
 We haven™t seen this for some time.  The 
latest figures that I see coming out
 of the economy [suggest], perhaps, even some slowing in rate 
of progress.  If we get some continued slowi
ng in retail sales, you have a dampening influence 
on inventory accumulation.  What is it that bri
ngs you to the idea of a stronger business demand 
over [unintelligible]? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, Governor Coldwell, 
we do have increased business spending on capital expenditures in the second half of ™76 compared with the first half of ™76, and we have a larger increase in inventory accumulation in the s
econd half of ™76 than in the first half.  These 
are somewhat larger than the in
crease in internal funds that™s occurring in that period, so on balance, we have a somewhat greater need for ne
t external financing on the part of nonfinancial corporations.  We believe that virtually all of this additional moderate external financing will 

take the form of short-term business loans rather
 than a further increase in the relatively large 
amount of long-term corporate borro
wing that has now occurred.   Of course, we could be wrong on several counts.  We could be wrong on the added 
inventory accumulation or the added spending;
 we could be wrong on the extent to which 
businesses are going [to borrow short term].  We
 don™t believe they™re going to want to lock themselves into relatively high long-term rates 
any more than they are now doing.  We may be 
wrong on that count, but the increase in business loans that were projecte
d is really rather moderate, well below the rates 
of increase of ™73 and ™74.  But it does represent a turnaround from the net declines that we were se
eing in the first half
 of this year.  MR. COLDWELL.  If you keep your level of in
ternal cash generation without any increase but keep the current level of long-term issues, isn™t that going to supply most of what you™re 
going to need to meet this inventor
y and capital expenditure requirement? 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, as I say, we have some 
increase in the net external need, so if you keep the level of bond issues, you need something 
else to finance the increase in net external need.  We are assuming much of that comes in business loans.  In addition, we are permitting 

businesses as a group to add a little more to liquid assets, so some of it 
gets absorbed in the liquid assets.  As a matte
r of fact, we really are projecting a slight decrease in corporate bond issues, so it stays pretty high but not a significant [unintelligible].  6/22/76 - 27 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any other questions?  Yes, Mr. Black. MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, Governor Coldwell 
raised pretty much the sort of question I 
had in mind about cash flow and the continued rest
ructuring of debts.  I guess I come out with 
the belief that short-term rates will go up, but probably not as much 
as you think, from all that he indicated, and I was just going to try to elicit the sort of comments you gave him. 
MR. AXILROD.  Well, President  
Black, I would be the last person to claim that I feel 100 
percent confident that rates will rise as much as 
we have in alternative B in the Bluebook, and if I 
were going to put an error around it, I would put a plus 1/2 on the top and a minus 1 on the 
bottom, something like that.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think we™d better stop at this point--we might become a little 
more precise.  Any other question or comment?  Yes, Mr. Wallich. 
MR. WALLICH.  In thinking about
 rates toward the end of the year, one has to look at the [unintelligible] levels of M1 and alternatives A, B, and C for early ™77, and those are so low, ranging from 2.8 under alternative A to 4.0 under C, that one wouldn™t be very surprised to see those produced [unintelligible].  That™s, of course, the consequence of having moved up much of 
our gross leeway in the second quarter.   MR. PARTEE.  Well, I think th
at™s quite right.  The staff is caught by the assumption of 
policies that they must take.  But, as in the 
first quarter, when we forgave an undershoot, we might well forgive an overshoot in
 the second quarter, in which case there would be some relief 
in that first-half growth in 1977, which would modify attitudes toward great-- MR. WALLICH.  Yes, all I™m trying to say is
, these projectio
ns of high short-term rates 
are partly the result of an
 artificial constraint.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think that™s right.  Any other comments?  Well, if not, we are 
ready to turn to our discussion of monetary policy and the kind of directive we want to issue to 
the New York Bank.   I think we have a relatively easy job to do this morning.  As far as I can see, the economy 
is expanding quite satisfactorily.  The decline in the rate of growth of real GNP during the second quarter is, by and large, I think a very healthy development--the co
ntinuation of the rate of growth of 8-3/4 percent would generate boom conditions very quickly.   Now, a good deal has been said this morning 
about the lull in consumer buying.  As all of 
us know, during the course of business cycle expansions, lulls of this type are a very frequent occurrence, and our more recent weekly data on re
tail sales and on automobile sales suggest that 
the lull is just about over.  And in any event, there is a significant pickup in activity in the durable goods sector, and I find the new orders figures very telling, particularly new orders for business capital goods.   The stock market certainly is reflecting a grea
t deal of continuing and probably expanding optimism.  As for money and interest rates, sinc
e mid-April, we™ve had a considerable run-up in 
short-term interest rates and a modest run-up in l
ong-term rates.  More re
cently, interest rates in 6/22/76 - 28 - 
    the short-term markets have stab
ilized.  The move that we™ve ta
ken, I think, has been a prudent one, though we have received some criticism; by 
and large, it has been well absorbed by the markets, and it has been well received, by and la
rge, as well, by the business and financial community.   My own feeling is that specifications under alternative B as indicated on page 6 in the Bluebook are close to the mark.  Some stability in
 money markets is indicated at the present 
time.  And actually, I would like the fed funds rate
 specification a little better if it were 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 rather than 5 to 6,  but I could go either way.   So as I see it, we are in a period where we ought to mark time, and I don™t think that we 
have a very difficult problem to deal with at th
is meeting.  But these are my simple thoughts, so 
let™s hear from members of the Committee.  
Who would  like to speak?  Yes, Mr. Jackson. 
MR. JACKSON.  I would generally concur with your comments, even to the [point] that I 
wouldn™t object to a money market directiv
e rather than the aggregates directive. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Mr. Partee. 

MR. PARTEE.  I would agree with your thrust, too, and I would prefer
 the 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 funds rate range because it seems 
to me that, within the range of
 monetary aggregates that we 
have, we shouldn™t be terribly upset by something th
at leans toward the high end or the low end.  I think I would stay with the monetary aggreg
ate directive but look for greater stability.   The only point that I might just have a little bi
t of disagreement about 
is, I would like to be a little more provisional about 
the economic outlook.  I think it is good.  I think that we will 
move ahead all right as we go into the summer a
nd early fall.  But at the moment, I am a little 
troubled about housing and consumer spending.  A
nd I think that is a good reason for pausing a bit in what may very well turn out to be a l
onger-term record of somewhat firmer rates and 
somewhat firmer money market conditions. 
MR. JACKSON.  I think the money market dire
ctive versus a half [percentage point] and a quarter [percentage point] on either side of
 the midpoint is in [unintelligible].   
MR. PARTEE.  Yes. MR. JACKSON.  So I don™t think it™s worth discussing.  MR. PARTEE.  Yes. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Partee. Mr. Mayo now, please. MR. MAYO.  Mr. Chairman, I subscribe to your
 comments.  I think I do prefer the full 5 to 6 range for fed funds with our usual tendency, which would be the same, I suppose, under 
both of our prescriptions of leaving it pretty much where it is.  But 
it gives a little more leeway to 
the Desk.   6/22/76 - 29 - 
    I think I™d like the idea of maybe
 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 for M1 as against 4 to 8.  I find it a little more in tune with our longer-term objectives, keeping those in a 
general subtle tendency perhaps of a bit lower.  I™m thinking also that the result
s of this meeting will be published very close to 
the time you go up to testify before the Ba
nking Committee at the e
nd of July.  And not prejudging where we are going to come out a month from now, I would make a guess that we 
probably would not be raising those ranges.  Indeed this might be
 in the right general area, and although it doesn™t make much substantive differe
nce, it probably would look a little better than the 4 to 8.  M2, I would take 6 to 10.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  One factua
l point.  I have just checked with Mr. Broida, we would be releasing our policy--what do we call the policy actions?  
MR. BROIDA.  Policy record. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  --the policy record--on 
July 23, and the testifying would take place 
on July 22.  MR. MAYO.  And I would use 6 to 10 for M2, not that that is critical
, but I would still pay a little more attention to M2, as 
we have the last couple of times.
  I would lean toward a money 
market directive this time, since 
that is perhaps a bette
r expression of the way [alternative] B is 
set up, but I don™t feel strongly about it. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Mayo.  Mr. Eastburn now, please. MR. EASTBURN.  Mr. Chairman, I would 
go along with your prescription.  I think alternative B as prescribed would be appropriate.  I would like to take a second, however, to revert to the earlier discussion about where we find ourselves with respect to the pattern of money growth and so on and interest rates.  We have done some exploring with other fore
casts, particularly work on DRI and a little bit with Michigan.  And, comparing them with 
the Greenbook and as far as the real economy is 
concerned, the results are pretty much the same fo
r all of those.  The interesting thing, however, is that these private forecasts come to this co
nclusion with the expecta
tion that M1 will grow considerably more rapidly in 
the next three quarters than the Greenbook has projected.  It™s something like 3 to 4 
percentage points.   Similarly, these outside forecasters are more 
optimistic on interest rates.  They see a 
Treasury bill rate about 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points lower at the year-end than does the Greenbook.  They see interest rates more along the line of what Steve was coming to, interest 
rates rising less than the Greenbook would have it.   In other words, what this suggests is that the Greenbook forecast, given those assumptions 
with respect to money supply and inte
rest rates, is optimistic.  And what this also suggests is that 
we may see some long-run implications--particula
rly next month, when we come to look at the 
long-run target--for whether we should reexamine those targets in the light of this, or at least to 
forgive the overshoot that we have had in the second quarter.   6/22/76 - 30 - 
    This is, I think, a problem in the making which 
we are going to have to consider.  For the 
moment, however, I think that thi
ngs are uncertain, but I would be content to hold where we are with alternative  B. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Eastburn.  Mr. Coldwell now, please. MR. COLDWELL.  Mr. Chairman, I™m delighted 
to join you in your prescription.  I would 
also prefer a narrower fed funds rate, mainly beca
use, with those wide margins [unintelligible].  
I™d prefer that the money market 
conditions stay stable and that we take time to pause while we 
decide whether this economic lull is going to con
tinue.  I don™t see any real evidence yet of a 
business loan expansion.  I value Steve™s judgment 
when he tells me that 
he™s at least partially convinced that it will occur sometime, and I woul
d agree with that judgment.  Someday I think 
we will see it, but I don™t see it yet, and I don™t 
really think it™s necessary that the policy must 
take an advance look at it that far down the line. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Coldwell.  Mr. Volcker now, please. VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don™t have any disagreement with the general pattern of the remarks that have been made, and, too, I™
m not terribly concerned over this hesitancy in the economy, although in our own proj
ections I guess we have it a little greater than the Board™s staff does.   I do remain concerned over the sluggishness 
of business investment.  As we look ahead, 
I™m a little less optimistic than the staff projections there.  And I™m also disturbed over the 

Gramley view of inflation, which is widely sh
ared I™m sure, but I do think there is some 
possibility of making some furt
her progress on inflation as expansion proceeds, and we ought to do what we can to facilitate it.  And that leaves me with somewhat opposite prescriptions of 
wanting to boost business investment but at the 
same time wanting to be very cautious on the 
inflationary side, which leaves me right in 
the middle where the re
st of you have been [unintelligible].   I would be very reluctant, however to see the actual fed funds rate go above 5-3/4 or below 5-1/4, so I™d be perfectly happy with that specification.  I do share Mr. Mayo™s feeling that we would be better off with a 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent M1 figure.  In addition to the reasons that he presented, which I think are valid, I would note that in New York, we have a lower projection of the M1 figure that would be right at the lower end of the 4 to 8 percent range.  So I would rather pick up the [alternative] C specification there of
 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and leave the [alternative] B 
specification for the M2 number.  But that™s a 
very small modification 
of the proposal you made 
and is directly in line with Mr. Mayo™s proposal. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Volcker.  Mr. MacLaury now please. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I likew
ise share what seems to be the 
consensus view of the economic outlook.  This is ju
st a pause.  On the funds rate range, I think we should be consistent.  If we are going to narrow the range to as small 
as 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, which I think is reasonable under current conditions, then we ought to use a money market directive 
rather than an aggregates directive.  I think that™s simply more c
onsistent with the facts.  I think 6/22/76 - 31 - 
    we are going to end up as Chuck indicated, forgiving or forgetting April™s bulge and not trying to retrace our steps as we go down the pike, and that would give us some leeway later on.   
I think likewise if we are going to use this
 narrowed range for the funds rate, perhaps 
there™s something to be said for what I think was 
a pattern we set at our last meeting of keeping 
our two-month targets consistent 
with our long-run targets.  I like that idea and I would like to reiterate it at this time, particul
arly if we are going to use, as I say, the narrower funds range.  It seems to me we can then stick with a narro
wer and lower money supply target, and I would 
simply buy the 4-1/2 to 7 percent range, ra
ther than the 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  All right.  Thank you, 
Mr. MacLaury.  Who would like to speak 
next?  Mr. Guffey, then Mr. Morris. 
MR. GUFFEY.  Well, Mr. Chairm
an, I agree with the narrowing of the fed funds range.  I guess my principal concern is that we don™t get a 
turnaround in the aggregates in July, and as a result I™d like to propose that we drop the top [end] of the 4 to 8 and the 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 a whole [percentage point] rather than a 
half .  If we are going to go with the money market conditions 
directive, if I understand it--and I™m not sure I totally do--but
 we would basically stay at 5-1/2 even if the aggregates begin coming in, under alte
rnative B, up to 8 percent, and I think that would be a mistake. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, no.  Mr. Sternlight, would you explain how you operate at the Desk in view of our recent practices? 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, I think we would observe a zone of indifference within which we would make no reaction but just continue to hold to the middl
e of a funds range.  If it were, say, 5-1/4, 3/4-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That zone
 of indifference would not be equal to the full M1 range. MR. STERNLIGHT.  But it would be something 
within the range [even] if we haven™t always agreed on just precisely what--how wide that zone is.  We tend to think of it [in terms of,] 
if the M1 range, say, was 4 percentage points, then perhaps 2 percentage points would be a zone of indifference.  But as we move
 beyond that then we would move 
to the higher or lower side of the funds range. MR. GUFFEY.  If I understand then, at the time you might get around 7 percent under 
money market conditions, then you might be movi
ng that fed funds rate up to the 5-3/4-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  If it were 4 to 8?   

MR. GUFFEY.  If we 
stick with 4 to 8. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  No, I don™t think so. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  I don™t think we would go all the way to 5-3/4.  We wouldn™t go all the way to the top of the funds range unless the aggregates were slightly over the top. 6/22/76 - 32 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Or at the top. 
MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well, all right, at the top. 

MR. GUFFEY.  Well, I guess you bolster my
 thought, and I™d like to see the range narrowed a little, and on the top side principally, a full percentage point under alternative B, which would bring it to 4 to 7 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2. 
 Because I™d hate to see us sit at the 5-1/2 level 
if we see those aggregates coming in fairly str
ong.  I™d like to see us move on to the 5-3/4. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Guffey.  Mr. Morris? MR. ROOS.  Mr. Chairman, may I just ask a qu
estion?  Is the significance of the lowering of the upper end of the fed funds rate from 6 to 
5-3/4 the psychological effect that the publication of 6 versus 5-3/4 would have?  In other words, 
why do we tend to artificially restrict ourselves from moving 1/4 of a point higher if circumstan
ces in the aggregates dictated our doing that.  Does that have a detrimental or a depressing psychologi
cal effect when it™s publis
hed?  Is that it?   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that question 
is better addressed not to Mr. Sternlight but to members of the Committee.  Let me a
ttempt an answer, and members of the Committee 
may wish to comment.  As of today, I would like 
some stability for a li
ttle while.  The money markets have stabilized, the monetary growth ra
tes have moderated.  I see no clear reason for 
moving in one direction or the other.   To move down to as low as 5, well, if the 
general expectation--and this extends far beyond our own staff--for some rise in short-term intere
st is valid--it™s certainly widely held--then to move down to 5 and then move up again very shor
tly I think would create unnecessary flurries.  
And likewise, to move up to 6, well, there is an 
element of uncertainty.  
Mr. Partee underlined it, Mr. Coldwell did.  I did not, but I don™t differ, really, from their vi
ews.  I doubt whether that is a wise decision today.  Two weeks later, one month later, it may well be. 
MR. MACLAURY.  Mr. Chairman, isn™t also another po
int on this, that 
if we got as high as 6 with the funds rate, it calls into question the discount rate, which is 5-1/2.  I think that becomes a potentially more pressing issue, a
nd you may or may not want to contemplate a 
discrete overt move that would 
be interpreted as tightening.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s we
ll worth keeping in mind. 
MR. PARTEE.  We know the [unint
elligible] is 5-3/4 as the top in this past intermeeting 
period.  Is that the point you were making, Larry, that if you put in a higher figure than the 5-3/4, it would look as if there was some
 movement that we could make? 
MR. ROOS.  Yes, that was my question. 

CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It would be interpreted to indicate some 
movement toward a 
tightening today. SPEAKER(?).  [Unintelligible.] 
6/22/76 - 33 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Yes, I do.  I think that is a valid observation. MR. WALLICH.  In a general di
rection, I think we have littl
e choice but to accept the rise 
in short-term rates.  This lull is
 perhaps not the best moment to 
start it, and as a compromise of 
these two things, I would go with the 5 to 6 fed funds rate.   I would also like to get back to a narrower aggregates targ
et.  We have had this time of 
great uncertainty about M1, and it may not be over.  But eventual
ly, I think 4 percentage points will be too wide, and I think this time we could a
fford to go to 4-1/2 to 7 and thereby match our 
long-term target.  I have no quarrel with the exis
ting specifications of M2, and I would prefer an aggregates directive. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Wallich.  Mr. Fossum now, please.   

MR. FOSSUM.  Mr. Chairman, we group ourselves
 with those that appraise the national recovery as still pretty solid and the economic outlook as quite fa
vorable.  As evidence of this, looking at the Sixth District, Florida is the state that had the deepest economic dips during the 
recent recession, not only in this-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  It™s an interesting comment.  Is that the deepest in the country or [just] in your District? MR. FOSSUM.  Well, [Florida™s
 recession is the] deepest in
 our District, and there are those who would point to it as, if not the deepest in the country, among those.  Its recovery is 
ahead of what was predicted just a month or tw
o ago.  Single-family housing starts and general 
employment figures are up in Florida.   
We had the responsibility this past month to put together the Redbook, which gave us a ringside opportunity to watch the response which came in from around the country on the 
question of capacity.  And while there was considerable variation from area to area, the general 
[impression we got] from that is 
that there is less excess capacity in the economy today than we 
would have thought with the-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  That™s the way I read the Redbook.   MR. FOSSUM.  And while there doesn™t seem to be any great bottleneck in the economy 
at the moment, looking on down the pike it would 
appear that we likely are going to have some 
supply problems by, say, mid-1977.  And so the way 
we read it, the issue for monetary policy 
seems to be whether we should in fact, as people
 are saying, get a head start on facing up to the price pressures that usually accompany those shor
tages, or growing shortages, or whether to pause.   And [our conclusion], all things considered, is that the bala
nce of argument favors a pause 
at this moment, since the growth
 in monetary aggregates seems to be moderate.  So we would 
certainly support your prescription.  As far as the ranges are concerned, I would like to see the fed funds range narrowed to 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 if, in fact, the Desk feel
s that they can operate within that range. 6/22/76 - 34 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Thank you, Mr. Fossum.  Mr. Baughman now, please. 
MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman,  I think I substa
ntially agree with the thread of 
discussion here, but there are a couple of aspects of it that bother me somewhat.  I fail to grasp 
the reason for the desire that has been expressed to go to the money ma
rket condition directive this time.  I just don™t quite grasp th
e reason why that should prevail.   I generally like the alternative B in terms of 
quantities, but I would share the view that the 
top on a couple of those measures could well come 
down a bit.  And I would be inclined to bring them down in line, I guess, with 
the longer-term objective, or target
.  In particular, looking back over the past year™s experience, I become pretty 
well persuaded that an M2 growth rate in excess of 10 percent is probably not consistent with the move toward economic stability.   
As to the range on the fed funds rate, there again, it seems to me 
that, in the current circumstances, 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 w
ould certainly take care of the needs that might develop over the 
next month.  But I don™t really see that we
 accomplish anything positive by knocking a quarter 
off of [the top and adding a quarter to] the bottom a 5 to 6 range.  But I could go 5-1/4, 5-3/4, and in fact, could go with the whole alternative B listing.  On M1, I prefer the top to drop to 
about 7 and on M2 the top to drop to 10.  CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Very good.  Thank you, Mr. Baughman.  Mr. Balles, next please. MR. BALLES.  Mr. Chairman, as far as the 
economy is concerned, I share the thought 
that™s been expressed by several others around the table that most likely we are just seeing a pause now and that we will experience, as the 
year goes on, pretty broadly based, solid, further 
growth.   And in that context I share what I think G
overnor Wallich was saying.  Take the Bluebook 
forecast of where we might be from an interest 
rate standpoint under the three alternatives, and I would prefer to see a little rise in interest rates now rather than a big one later on.  And therefore it would not disturb me to see the fed funds 
rate climb up to 5-3/4 percent during this 
intermeeting period.  And given that
 conclusion, I would lean toward the full 5 to 6 percent range 
on the fed funds rate.   With respect to ranges for M1 and M2, I shar
e the view that™s alre
ady been expressed by three to four members that the 
top end of the short-term range 
should not exceed the top end of our longer-term range.  We™re already, from the 
standpoint of the level of the aggregates, over the rates that we have set out for ourselves in terms of the 12-month target.   
In that respect, I would just like to refer briefly to an experimental set of charts that I 
distributed last month and again this month to th
e members of this group, which is an effort to 
try to relate our short-term actions to our 12-month target.  We set these 12-month targets, as we 
all know, to give ourselves a considerable degree 
of latitude in M1, M2, and M3.  They are fairly 
wide ranges that allow a good deal of flexibility, as I think is perfectly appropriate.  And yet at 
the same time, some of us have been making 
an effort to get a better tracking mechanism on 
where we stand on the level of the Ms--through the use of moving averages as, in my view, a best indicator--in order to get away from a pr
oblem you pose, which is 4 equals 8, that is, the unreliability of any given month™s seasonally adjusted data.   
6/22/76 - 35 - 
    I think that we have a method for getting 
around that through the use of this filtering 
device of smoothing the data through moving averages.  [We us
e] the Board of Governors™ own staff forecast of five weeks ahead as to where the Ms 
are likely to be.  And the 
net of all of that is 
charts that I have been using that show that we are above our own range for both M1 and M2.  And I find it difficult, therefore, to support any short-term range
 which would bring us further above the upper limit of a longer-term
 range that we ourselves set.   So that™s my rationale for supporting an upper 
limit for M1 of 7 percent for the next two months and an upper limit for M2 of 10 percent.  And in fact, if we were to take the next step that would bring our short-term targets within at
 least the upper bound of our longer-term targets, 
we would have to have a lower limit for M1 of
 2 percent for the next two months and a lower limit for M2 of 5 percent.  And if we were to
 follow those lower limits, that would bring us 
barely down to the top end of our longer-term ranges by the end of July.   
I think that this Committee is still faced with
 an unresolved problem of how to limit its 
short-term targets for this longer-term range.  Th
ese charts that I™ve been playing around with are an effort to do that.  I™m not sure we™ll get there right away, but I see an unresolved problem in 
[that] we are able to [unintelligible] month by month with what we set out for ourselves as a  [unintelligible] wide range of growth in the aggregates for a 12-month period ahead.  And doing 
a little forecasting, I suspect that what we™ll end up with next month 
is to forget the overshoot in the second quarter.  And if we do that without the second quarter as a base for the next 12 months ahead, and even if we were to make no ch
ange in the growth rate ranges of both M1 and M2, we end up with something like $3 billion more of M1 by the first quarter of ™77.   
Or, to put it another way, by the time we get to 
the fourth quarter of this year, if we forget the second-quarter overshoot, which I™m not oppos
ed to, we would end up with year-to-year growth of M1 of something like 5.8 percent from 
the  fourth quarter of ™75 [to the] fourth [quarter of] ™76.  Due to your last testimony 
on our longer-term goals, it seems to me that 
5.8 percent in the calendar year of ™76 is a very generous, maybe overly generous, rate of 
monetary growth in view of the fact that we have not gotten inflation down as much as I would 
like to see it, and [also] in view of my personal hunch that, if anything, the rate of inflation is going to get somewhat worse rather 
than better in the months ahead. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, that™s a very in
teresting comment.  I only wish we could have the time to pursue it.  The only comment that I would make is
 you have been entirely silent on the velocity factor.  [There] has been a change, and the change seems to be the dramatic 
increase that we have had over three quarters that isn™t being repeated in the present quarter and 
may not be in the succeeding quarters. 
MR. BALLES.  Well, I think we ought to as
k you, as the most successful forecaster of 
velocity, Mr. Chairman, what you think is going to happen. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I don™t think that the level we had in the third and fourth quarters of last year and the first quarter of this year is 
going to be repeated.  I think we will get a little 
lower level. 
6/22/76 - 36 - 
    MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, Murray Altmann co
mplained to me at the coffee break that 
he™s going to have a hard time writing an expa
nded policy record this time because [there] 
wasn™t enough dissent.   CHAIRMAN BURNS.  If that is Mr. Altmann™s comment, I don™t think you should take it too seriously. MR. MORRIS.  I can™t help him this time, I promised in
 some future date to help him.  But 
I think at this point I support your thesis that the appropriate policy is a pause, so I therefore support your narrow range of the funds rate.  I would not be concerned to lower the upper ranges of the aggregates because, if the only long-term objective we™re concerned about is the most 
recent one we made, it is true that we are running 
above that more recent objective, but it™s also 
true that we are about in the mi
ddle of the objective through the fourth quarter, and we are a little 
on the low side of the objective [unintelligible] the third quarter.   
Now, all of the discussion seems to be cente
red around the most recent path, and if this 
means that the earlier paths are 
to be ignored, then in effect we only have a three-month 
projection instead of a 12-month projection factor.  Seems to me
 we have to give some concern 
to the other objectives and also 
to the fact that in establishing the most recent path and the 
preceding path, we established them in relatively 
low quarters.  So it seems to me that I™m not 
concerned about what is called this second quarter
 bulge.  And I™m a little happy, in fact, that we 
are going to continue our procedure, [although] I think, sooner or later, it™s going to get us in trouble projecting 12 months ahead on the most 
recent quarter regardless of what random 
movements may have biased that
 recent quarter up or down. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  If we think a bias is mi
sleading us, there is a 
very simple way of 
correcting for it and that is to have a lowe
r rate of growth for the next 12 months.  MR. MORRIS.  Well, I™m not so sure, Mr. Ch
airman, that it™s simple from the public 
relations point of view.  That is, I think it would take a lot of explaining, and a lot of getting the message across, if we were to come out w
ith the substantially lower rates and adjust 
[unintelligible] if we had a higher base.  So I™m concerned about the-- 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We™ll have 
difficulty either way, I think-- MR. MORRIS.  --since maybe one of these days, 
one of these quarters, we are going to run into a situation where, in order to avoid an excessi
vely rapid or an excessively slow growth in the money supply, we would have to come out with
 numbers for the next 12 months which the 
public and the press are likely to misinterpret as meaning a ra
dical shifting in policy in one direction or another.  I was talking [about it] to Mr. Partee this morning at breakfast as something 
that our Subcommittee on the Dire
ctive ought to examine, not in 
terms of the immediate problem 
but in terms of what sorts of situations this 
might lead us to.  That
™s all I have to say.  MR. WINN.  I have no quarrel with the sense 
of the discussion, Mr. Chairman, and if we 
are right, then the behavior is going to be pretty much on target anyway.  But I think if we are wrong, we ought to consider whether we ought to go to a money market target at this stage 
because of the difficulty of extricating ourselves 
if we are wrong on either side.  I would be a lot 
6/22/76 - 37 - 
    happier to stay with an aggregate target than I would a money 
market target, even though I have 
no desire to do anything but keep
 a low visibility and hope thi
ngs will stay about the same.  
MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, today seems to 
be a day where an unusually large number of 
hybrid policy prescriptions are emerging.  I guess mi
ne is of the same variety.  I would go for a 
full 5 to 6 percent range on fed funds.  I feel 
the economy is probably going to be somewhat 
stronger than the staff has projected.  The international economy is heating up, and the Puerto Rico [G-7 summit] meeting may lead to some fu
rther tightening of foreign monetary and fiscal 
policy, and so I want that full maneuverability.   
At the same time, I really don™t believe that
 the aggregates are going to show quite the growth that the staff thinks, and I would be a little happier with 3 to 7 percent on M1 and 5 to 9 on M2.  And having said this, I would then do about what you recommended originally and keep 
the fed funds rate around 5-1/2, unless one or the other of the aggregates starts breaking out on the top side.  This might suggest 
that I would favor a money market
 directive, but my prejudices 
lie in the other direction, and I would still stick with an aggregates directive. MR. ROOS.  Briefly, if we are going to agree with the wisdom of 
a policy of temporary 
pause, and if we do look ahead to 
the projections of rates in the 7-1/2 to 8 percent range, fourth quarter [of 1976], first quarter of ‚77, I think we should be alert to the possible need to gradually get toward those rate levels. If I had my druthers as a voting member, I w
ould prefer to see us go to the 6 percent upper limit [on the federal funds rate] even
 though the Desk did not reach that 
level.  But we would certainly accept the wisdom fo
r thirty days of sticking to 5-1/4 to 5-3/4.  
We would prefer narrower M1 and M2 ranges, reducing the upper limits of each of those 
aggregates.  MR. GARDNER.  At the start of this mee
ting I was persuaded that we didn™t have sufficient cause to go [unintelligible] to alternativ
es A or C, so I obviously support the pause.  I 
think the pause is appropriate.  I want to comment that we do meet monthly on a regularly 
scheduled basis.  If we met on a basis related to
 events in the marketpl
ace, we might not have 
had a meeting today.  I want to just say that I™m 
rather pleased that we are in a position where we 
can pause to some extent.   
I think we started a process earlier to build a little bit of sti
ffening in the rates.  At this 
point it seems to me that the evidence is unclear
 and that we don™t have sufficient cause to make 
important changes.  I™m impressed [by the proposal
 to pause] because of the propensity of human 
beings to act when they come together.  So far 
we have a general consensus of not much action.   
I would make one plea.  I™m very sensitive to
 the fed funds rate because, in the banking 
world, these rates result from the interactions 
and expectations of ma
ny people in the money 
market, whereas your aggregates ar
e published as statistical facts.  I would therefore urge on the Committee that we do narrow the range.  I think 
a 6 percent fed funds rate during a pause would be a mistake.  I think we should perhaps consider
 this again as events move on in the economy.  
So I would vote strongly for 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, narrowing the fed funds range. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I think we have had a useful discussion.  There are differences among us that I think are at the margin.  I think we
 could start, perhaps, with the fed funds range.  6/22/76 - 38 - 
    There is some margin within the Committee in favor
 of a 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 range, but let™s test that with a show of hands from the members of th
e Committee [to see whether] that range will be 
generally acceptable [if] not necessa
rily preferred.  And then we 
can test another range, a wider 
range, if that is the Committee™s wish.  All thos
e who can be relatively comfortable with a range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 for the fed funds rate range 
will kindly indicate that by raising your hands.   MR. BROIDA
.  Eight, Mr. Chairman.   
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Would you want that tested?  No strong 
wish as to the range for M1.  I think that, on the basis of the record before me, a range of 4 to 8 seems to be preferred by 
a thin majority of the Committee.  I think there 
is a good case to be made for 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and 
that might be a compromise for the views expre
ssed all around the table. 
 Let™s choose between the two.  Those who prefer 4 to 8 as over against 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, would you kindly raise your hands.  Three.   Now let™s see if our arithmetic is correct.  T
hose who prefer 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 as over against 4 to 8, would you kindly raise your hands.  Eight.   I think that implies that M2 would be 6 to 10 rather than 6-1/2 to 10-1/2.   Now there is a question about the directive.  Now logic is something to be recognized but not always to be effected.  Logically we have the money market di
rective if we go with a 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 percent range.  But as I say, logic is not and should not always be respected in life.  Let us 
have a show of hands.  Those who prefer a m
oney market directive a
nd the language of the money market directive which r
eads, ﬁThe Committee seeks to ma
intain prevailing bank reserves and money market conditions 
over a period ahead, etc.ﬂ  
Now those who would prefer a money market 
directive as over against the monetary 
aggregates directive will kindly raise their hands.  Three.   It™s reasonably clear that the monetary aggreg
ate directive will express the sentiment of the 
majority somewhat better, and I prefer it myse
lf, even though logic is thrown to the wind. MR. JACKSON.  Chairman, nobody discusse
d relative weights of the [M1 and M2] aggregates and-- CHAIRMAN BURNS.  We were proceeding in 
this meeting on the principle of assigning 
approximately equal weights for the two. 
MR. JACKSON.  It appears from staff projecti
ons that the behavior in the savings deposit market would be different from expectations, that
 it may be more different to date, and I would 
personally be inclined to shade emphasis
 on M2 somewhat compared to 50-50.  
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any view on that? 
MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, the savings depo
sits, the other time deposits, did behave 
in a sense a little differently 
than we had for these particular M1s--they remained relatively 
stronger.  But the savings deposit actually behaved about as we had thought, and there was an 
6/22/76 - 39 - 
    outflow, and what didn™t behave as we had thoug
ht was the other time deposits that we™re 
offsetting.  And I would tend to agree that when you are in a period here of interest rates having moved above Regulation Q ceilings, you get uncertainti
es on deposit flows, and that puts a little 
more uncertainty on M2 and M1, but it™s a marginal matter. 
SPEAKER(?).  I think we may have accomplished my result whether we changed the 
directive or not. CHAIRMAN BURNS.  I have not observed any degree of uncertainty with regard to projections of M1. MR. PARTEE.  I just wanted to point out a sm
all arithmetic fact, and that is that saying 
equal emphasis on M1 and M2 approximately mean
s that in fact you place about 3/4 emphasis 
on M1 because M1 is contained in M2, which is plenty for me. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Any sentiment to move
 away from the approximate equality?  
Apparently there is no such sentiment.   
I think we are ready for a vote, and we™ll be voting on the following:  a monetary aggregates directive; a range for M1 at 3-1/2 to 7-1/2; a range for M2 of 6 to 10; a range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-3/4; a
nd understanding that M1 and M2 will receive 
approximately equal weight at the Desk. A
ny questions?  We are ready for the vote.

MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr. Chairman, can
 I raise a very small point? 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Small or large. 

MR. BAUGHMAN.  For some period of time it has bot
hered me that we
 have described the rate of change in wage rates as moderate or something that is sort of vague.  And it appears 
again in the general paragraph of line 16. 6/22/76 - 40 - 
    CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that, I mu
st confess I™ve gotten into the habit of having so much to do that I have paid very little attention to the general paragraphs--I think you are right.  It can be interpreted as a blessing by us.  I would just omit the word and have it read, 
ﬁthe advance in the index of average wage  rates was larger in May than th
e gains in other recent months,ﬂ and so on.  I don™t think we ought to bless it by characterizing it one way or the other. MR. BAUGHMAN.  It™s quite inconsistent w
ith the achievement of economic stability. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that po
int is very well taken.  Any objection to deleting the word moderate on 16?   
MR. VOLCKER. I think it is a good idea. 
MR. PARTEE.  I do also think, Mr. Chairman, th
at we ought to ask the staff to insert a reference to the CPI. 
CHAIRMAN BURNS.  Well, I think that™s a very good observation.  All right, our staff will do that.   
Let™s turn to item 6, and this arises b
ecause of Mr. Holland™s resignation.  If it™s satisfactory to the Committee, I would suggest th
at the responsibility previously borne by Mr. Holland now be assumed by Governor Gardner and in his absence by Governor Coldwell.  Any 

objections to that?  All right.  
Now, item 7 may or may not evoke a debate.  
There is one reason--quite apart from the 
factor of time--for delaying it, and that is that Mr. Holmes is absent
.  All right, we simply have to confirm the date for the next meeting, and I ta
ke it there is no question involving that, and therefore we conclude our mee
ting at a very early hour.   SPEAKER(?).  Could we note for the record th
at we started at 9:30 this morning and had an executive session, and nevertheless we ended at 1 p.m.
